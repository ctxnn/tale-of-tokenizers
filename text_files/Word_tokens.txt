south
australia
(
sa
)
has
a
unique
position
in
australia
'
s
history
as
,
unlike
the
other
states
which
were
founded
as
colonies
,
south
australia
began
as
a
self
governing
province
many
were
attracted
to
this
and
adelaide
and
sa
developed
as
an
independent
and
free
thinking
state
.
the
compound
of
philosophical
radicalism
,
evangelical
religion
and
self
reliant
ability
typical
of
its
founders
had
given
an
equalitarian
flavour
to
south
australian
thinking
from
the
beginning
.
it
was
into
this
social
setting
that
in
february
1850
a
meeting
was
called
primarily
for
the
formation
of
an
association
(
apparently
meaning
a
y
.
m
.
c

a

)
for
apprentices
and
others
,
after
their
day
'
s
work
,
to
enjoy
books
,
lectures
,
discussions
,
readings
,
friendly
relief
and
recreation
for
a
leisure
hour
.
in
september
1850
records
show
that
this
became
the
young
men
'

of

report
1851
.
there
was
no
census
in
1850
but
the
1851
census
put
the
total
population
of
south
australia
at
63
,
700
with
males
numbering
35
,
302
.
the
discovery
of
gold
in
ballarat
caused
a
large
migration
from
south
australia
and
by
1852
some
8000
had
left
for
the
goldfields
.
as
a
consequence
the
various
ymca
groups
that
had
become
established
failed
and
by
1870
none
remained
.

of

are
"
wasting

for

a

excerpt
from
the
book
:
when
she
was
asked
first
time
about
the
journey
ahead
,
her
mother
,
fatima
,
responded
indirectly
to
her
by
these
statements
.
she
told
her
about
yasmeen
'
s
flower
,
which
her
name
comes
from
it
.
she
said
yasmeen
'
s
flower
is
always
convinced
to
the
least
.
this
plant
does
not
need
much
care
.
a
single
drop
of
fertilizer
per
each
spring
is
enough
for
it
.
suffice
it
to
be
slightly
moist
,
then
no
irrigation
is
needed
.
all
types
of
jasmine
flowers
prefer
to
grow
in
a
sunny
place
but
also
tolerate
the
presence
of
shade
.
the
tunisian
sun
is
suitable
for
blossoming
and
completing
personality
of
this
flower
,
but
it
has
the
ability
to
withstand
the
shade
and
cold
climate
of
europe
.
like
the
mediterranean
white
jasmine
,
which
is
very
delicate
in
appearance
but
strong
in
character
.
yasmeen
'
s
unique
fragrance
conveys
a
sense
of
sincerity
that
other
roses
lack
.
<
br
>
she
did
not
ask
about
the
importance
of
the
emotions
that
this
flower
brings
.
she
knew
that
giving
a
woman
a
jasmine
flower
sometimes
meant
,
"
why
didn
'
t
you
ever
love
me
?
"
just
as
her
father
had
given
her
,
yasmeen
,
to
her
mother
.
it
was
her
father
'
s
last
gift
to
her
mother
because
he
had
been
evading
custody
of
yasmeen
after
divorce
.
after
that
,
her
mother
never
accepted
anyone
'
s
love
because
she
had
dedicated
herself
to
love
for
yasmeen
.
<
br
>
she
increasingly
felt
the
absence
of
his
mother
more
day
after
day
.
over
time
,
she
became
more
confident
that
she
would
be
lost
without
him
.
she
knew
that
being
a
foreigner
was
not
an
easy
experience
.
however
,
he
had
agreed
to
take
the
trip
.
her
mother
had
taught
him
how
to
be
a
real
jasmine
,
but
she
may
have
overlooked
the
bitter
truth
:
when
it
leaves
its
soil
,
jasmine
quickly
fades
away
and
wraps
itself
beautifully
in
the
dry
.

text
of
the
book
:
everything
was
cool
and
exciting
until
i
decided
to
make
a
change
in
my
desperate
path
and
do
something
extraordinary
to
get
me
out
of
this
absurdity
hell
.
after
that
,
in
one
of
the
autumn
night
,
when
i
stepped
on
the
boat
that
had
stopped
on
the
shore
,
the
moonlight
has
faded
from
my
life
,
and
my
life
became
a
improvisations
series
of
exceptional
cases
.
from
then
on
,
i
went
through
different
adventures
and
endangered
my
life
many
times
.
i
became
close
to
the
borders
of
death
by
drowning
and
deprived
myself
of
justice
,
i
even
almost
fell
into
the
realm
of
the
dead
.
over
and
over
,
i
found
myself
hoping
to
return
to
a
monotonous
life
with
no
excitement
.
i
was
scared
to
be
forgotten
in
a
corner
and
die
alone
.
i
was
afraid
that
i
had
ruined
my
normal
life
for
nothing

:
if
she
could
paint
a
simple
picture
of
her
life
,
of
course
if
she
had
been
so
aware
,
she
recognized
that
it
was
all
just
suffering
.
each
suffering
depicts
a
different
path
,
expressing
certain
meanings
that
she
was
unaware
of
it
.
.
.
every
suffering
had
to
search
for
the
next
suffering
to
find
its
way
.
.
.
in
the
meantime
she
was
looking
for
a
way
to
get
rid
of
it
and
always
asked
:
which
event
,
like
a
tornado
,
shook
the
pillars
of
her
monotonous
life
?
.
.

just
when
there
was

keep

tayside
junior
football
league
the
tayside
junior
football
league
,
originally
called
the
"
midlands
league
"
,
was
a
football
league
competition
operated
in
tayside
under
the
scottish
junior
football
association
which
operated
as
the
top
league
in
the
territory
until
a
merger
in
2002
;
it
existed
for
a
further
four
years
as
a
second
-
tier
league
before
the
name
was
discontinued
in
2006
.
junior
football
had
been
played
in
the
region
since
the
1890s
,
but
it
was
not
until
a
restructuring
across
scotland
in
the
late
1960s
that
all
teams
in
the
territory
were
brought
together
under
one
umbrella
-
previously
they
had
been
competing
in
the
local
leagues
in
angus
,
perthshire
and
dundee
,
though
the
membership
of
these
was
not
always
rigidly
dependant
on
geography
,
and
another
"
midland
league
"
also
existed
from
the
1920s
to
the
1940s
involving
clubs
from
all
three
territories
.
due
to
predicted
difficulties
in
arranging
the
new
format
,
an
extra
year
was
requested
for
its
completion
by
the
local
committees
,
and
the
midland
(
tayside
)
leagues
began
in
1969
,
a
year
after
the
rest
of
scotland
(
the
north
was
the
only
one
of
the
six
new
regions
which
required
more
than
minor
adjustment
to
its
structure
)
.
with
titles
having
been
shared
between
clubs
from
perthshire
and
dundee
(
the
sole
angus
champions
in
1974
being
kirrie
thistle
)
,
the
league
'
s
balance
altered
dramatically
in
1990
when
tayport
joined
the
setup
;
their
base
was
actually
in
the
far
north
of
fife
but
they
were
permitted
to
join
the
tayside
league
as
they
were
closer
to
many
of
its
teams
via
the
tay
road
bridge
.
the
"
port
"
almost
immediately
began
to
dominate
and
did
not
finish
outside
the
top
two
places
from
1991
until
2002
,
when
the
tayside
leagues
were
merged
with
the
fife
league
and
the
east
(
lothians
)
league
to
form
a
new
scottish
junior
football
association
,
east
region
superleague
.
despite
the
challenge
of
facing
the
strongest
clubs
from
these
other
two
areas
,
tayport
continued
to
be
among
the
leading
teams
for
the
first
six
years
;
dundee
side
lochee
united
also
finished
as
east
region
champions
twice
in
that
period
.
tayside
'
s
setup
was
retained
as
a
feeder
division
to
the
superleague
along
with
the
other
historic
districts
until
2006
,
when
they
were
fully
integrated
into
the
east
region
;
tayside
'
s
section
(
minus
the
perthshire
teams
which
were
placed
with
the
fife
sides
)
became
the
north
division
below
the
super
league
and
a
new
premier
division
.
in
2018
,
a
large
group
of
east
junior
clubs
joined
the
east
of
scotland
football
league
,
aspiring
to
gain
entry
to
the
senior
scottish
professional
football
league
in
future
years
;
however
,
on
tayside
the
only
ones
to
do
so
were
the
perth
teams
jeanfield
swifts
and
kinnoull
.
this
led
to
a
north
-
south
reorganisation
of
the
remaining
members
of
the
region
,
with
the
2019
20
superleague
north
entirely
compsed
of
former
tayside
clubs

typhoon
phanfone
(
2019
)
typhoon
phanfone
,
known
in
the
philippines
as
typhoon
ursula
,
was
a
relatively
strong
and
deadly
tropical
cyclone
which
traversed
through
the
philippines
on
christmas
eve
and
christmas
day
for
the
first
time
since
nock
-
ten
in
2016
.
the
twenty
-
ninth
and
final
named
storm
of
the
2019
pacific
typhoon
season
,
the
origins
of
phanfone
can
be
traced
to
an
upper
-
level
low
which
had
formed
near
the
caroline
islands
and
gradually
organized
into
a
tropical
depression
on
december
19
.
moving
generally
west
-
northwestard
,
the
system
intensified
into
a
tropical
storm
on
december
22
and
moved
into
the
philippine
area
of
responsibility
on
the
following
day
as
it
continued
gaining
strength
.
phanfone
intensified
to
typhoon
status
shortly
before
making
its
first
landfalls
over
the
eastern
visayas
region
on
christmas
eve
.
further
intensification
ensued
until
christmas
day
despite
phanfone
making
several
landfalls
over
the
central
philippine
islands
,
peaking
at
150
km
/
h
(
90
mph
)
10

minute
sustained

with
a
central
pressure
dropping
to
970
hpa
.
phanfone
maintained
its
typhoon
strength
for
several
hours
as
it
exited
the
philippine
landmass
before
unfavorable
conditions
caused
it
to
rapidly
deteriorate
and
dissipate
over
the
south
china
sea
.
phanfone
crossed
the
central
philippines
after
the
stronger
kammuri
struck
nearly
the
same
region
merely
weeks
prior
,
with
a
track
fairly
similar
to
2013
s
haiyan
.
the
system
caused
destruction
in
the
visayas
region
,
particularly
over
samar
,
leyte

.
the
total
fatalities
of
the
said

sufficient
banding
around
a
defined

,
the
jtwc
subsequently
upgraded

(

)
at

am
pst
december
23
and
the
philippine
weather
bureau
pagasa
locally
named
the

.
owing

storm
hours
later

.
by

26
,
phanfone
had
already
exited
the
philippine
landmass
,
moving
northwest
over
the
south
china
sea
.
after
holding
strength
for
several
hours
,
the
system
began
losing
strength
due
to
unfavorable
sea
surface
temperatures
,
medium
wind
shear
and
dry
air
intrusion
.
on
december
27
,
phanfone
dropped
to

storm
status
while
rapidly
deteriorating
and
slowly
moving

,
pagasa
issued
its
final
warning
as
the
system
exited
the
par
;
later
,
jma
issued
their
final
advisories
as
phanfone
weakened
below
warning
threshold
.
the
pagasa
issued
a

3
warning
to

the
pagasa
also
issued
a

cebu
,
northeastern
iloilo
,
northern
antique
,
capiz
,
aklan
,
southern
leyte
,
and
negros
occidental
,
which
meant
that
phanfone
was
taking
a
similar
path
to
the
areas
hit
by
the
much
stronger
typhoon
haiyan
.
the
visayas
was
the
worst
hit
,
with
iloilo
city
having
13
casualties
alone
that

been
either
struck
by

a
ghost
town
.
severe

damage
in
the
many
provinces

partially
to
completely
submerged
.
multiple
houses
were
crumpled
and
trees
were
downed
,
as
well
as
power
lines
being
downed
.
all
of
these
obstacles
blocked
off
roads
and
made
roads
dangerous
to
walk
on
;
and
the
excessive
amounts
of
rainfall
made
ground
,
especially
higher
ground
,
very
unstable

was
badly
hit
with
severe
and
swift

moving
flash
floods

the
worst
of

took

,
"
the

"
from
a
statement
hodgkinson
made
in
one
of

notebooks
,
paraphrasing
paulo
freire
in
"
pedagogy
of
the
oppressed
"
,
that
henry

wants
to
"
transform

;
the

chronicles
the
history
of
henry
cow
and
their
exploration
of
music
and
activism
,
from
their
inception
in
1968
to
their
break
-
up
in
1978
.
it
also
analyses
of
the
nature
of
the
band
and
the
way
they
functioned
.
they
were
a
collective
with
a
strict
work
-
ethic
that
demanded
total
commitment
from
its
members
.
they
held
regular
meetings
where
all
aspects
of
the
group
,
its
music
and
activities
were
debated
.
this
tended
to
suppress
individualism
and
made
the
band
more
important
than
its
members
,
which
strained
relationships
within
the
group
,
and
with
partners
on
the
outside
.
the
book
explains
how
henry
cow
were
at
odds
with
the
status
quo
,
the
music
industry
and
the
world
at
large
.
they
were
politically
outspoken
and
embraced
marxism
and
maoism
.
they
were
not
content
to
settle
and
continually
experimented
with
new
ideas
.
the
brief
merger
with
slapp
happy
in
1975
,
the
formation
of
the
orckestra
with
the
mike
westbrook
brass
band
and
folk
singer
frankie
armstrong
in
1977
,
and
the
establishment
of
the
rock
in
opposition
movement
in
1978
,
were
some
of
several
ventures
they
initiated
.
henry
cow
'
s
approach
to
composition
is
discussed
,
and
the
musical
structure
and
lyrics
(
where
present
)
of
many
of
their
more
prominent
works
,
including
frith
'
s
"
ruins
"
and
hodgkinson
'
s
"
living
in
the
heart
of
the
beast
"
,
are
analysed
in
detail
.
the
band
improvised
much
of
their
music
,
particularly
during
live
performances
,
and
this
style
of
playing
included
free
improvisation
,
studio
improvisation
to
tape
(
for
example
on
their
1974
album
,
"
unrest
"
)
,
and
open
improvisation

reviewing
"
henry
cow
:
the
world
is
a
problem
"
in
the
british
progressive
rock
magazine
,
"
prog
"
,
sid
smith
called
it
an
"
impressively
detailed
account
[
that
]
chronicle
[
s
]
[
henry
cow
'
s
]
triumphs
and
camaraderie
"
.
he
added
that
through
their
"
often
-
turbulent
existence
"
,
the
band
'
s
struggle
"
against
the
prevailing
tides
of
commerciality
and
popular
culture
.
.
.
has
a
heroic
quality
about
it
"
.
smith
wrote
that
if
the
success
of
a
music
biography
is
measured
by
the
desire
to
revisit
the
group
'
s
albums
,
then
this
book
is
"
enormously
successful
"
.
he
said
piekut
'
s
"
forensic
examination
"
of
henry
cow
'
s
recordings
adds
another
dimension
to
their
music
.
smith
concluded
that
the
book
"
is
a
fitting
tribute
to
henry
cow
'
s
importance
and
legacy
in
a
notable
but
marginalised
movement
of
20th
-
century
music
.
"
phil
howitt
wrote
in
the
canterbury
scene
magazine
,
"
facelift
"
that
while
henry
cow
may
not
have
been
part
of
the
canterbury
scene
,
piekut
'
s
book
can
be
read
as
"
almost
a
parallel
narrative
to
that
of
the
canterbury
scene
"
,
given
the
number
of
musicians
from
that
"
genre
"
who
either
played
in
,
or
were
associated
with
,
the
band
.
howitt
described
"
the
world
is
a
problem
"
as
a
"
definitive
biography
"
that
is
"
meticulously
researched
"
leaving
few
stones
unturned
.
he
said
that
just
as
henry
cow
were
"
an
intensely
serious
band
"
,
this
is
an
"
intensely
serious
book
"
that
requires
"
considerable
powers
of
concentration
and
assiduousness
"
.
howitt
found
the
analyses
of
their
different
types
of
improvisation
and
their
political
alignments
"
heavy
going
"
.
he
also
felt
that
the
in
-
depth
descriptions
of
some
of
the
band
'
s
compositions
were
"
somewhat
unnecessary
"
as
they
would
only
benefit
a
limited
audience
.
what
was
also
missing
,
howett
felt
,
was
a
timeline
of
events
covering
henry
cow
'
s
history
.
but
overall
howett
called
"
the
world
is
a
problem
"
"
a
remarkable
project
"
that
is
"
compelling
[
and
]
unique
"
.
chris
cutler
,
henry
cow
'
s
drummer
,
described
the
book
as
a
"
cornucopia
of
invaluable
information
"
.
he
said
it
is
a
well
-
researched
and
detailed
account
of
the
band
,
but
suggested
that
in
places
,
it
is
"
best
[
to
]
read
between
the
lines
"
.
because
some
of
the
band
members
kept
more
detailed
records
than
others
,
their
viewpoints
tend
to
feature
more
prominently
in
the
book
,
leaving
some
parts
"
uneven
"
.
cutler
added
that
where
piekut
had
to
interpret
different
people
'
s
accounts
of
events
,
it
is
likely
that
not
everyone
in
the
band
will
concur
with
his
analysis
.
cutler
said
that
"
subjectivities
are
profoundly
complex
"
,
and
attempts
to
"
unearth
things
that
were
already
hidden
when
they
were
current
"
will
be
"
guided
by
[
personal
]
biases
and
interests
"

aims
to
dispel
myths
surrounding
the
jallianwala

massacre
that
took
place
in
amritsar
,
india
,
on
13

the

significant
differences
between

,
wagner
examines
primary
sources
to
trace
the
events
leading
up
to
the
massacre
and
then
discusses
its
aftermath
.
according
to
wagner
,
the
background
to
the
massacre
starts
with
the
indian
rebellion
of
1857
and
the
subsequent
british
fear
of
a
recurrence
.
by
1919
,
indians
aspired
to
greater
self
-
governance
,
a
wish
frustrated
by
the
proposals
of
the
rowlatt
act
.
the
result
was
mahatma
gandhi
'
s
satyagraha
movement
,
which
persuaded
indians
to
pursue
nonviolent
resistance
to
the
british
.
fearing
another

,
events
in
amritsar
unfolded
into
indian
political
agitation
,
the
arrest
of
two
key
indian
political
leaders
,
and
british
panic
.
then
came
general
dyer
'
s
action
towards
a
large
peaceful
crowd
and
the
killings
at
jallianwalla
bagh
.
british
authorities
responded
with
martial
law
and
the
arrest
and
torture
of
a
number
of
indians
in
amritsar
.
contrary
to
a
number
of
widely
held
beliefs
,
wagners
research
reveals
an
alternative
number
of
how
many
were
killed
in
the
massacre
,
how
many
were
found
in
the
well

at

wagner
explains
that
"
the
amritsar
massacre
isn
t
understood
very
well
"
,
particularly
in
the
absence
of
any
photographs
of
the
13
april
1919
and
with
a
significant
variation
in
british
and
indian
accounts
of
how
many
were
killed
and
how
and
why
it
happened
.
in
his
book
,
he
examines
primary
sources
to
trace
the
events
leading
up
to
the
massacre
and
discusses
its
aftermath
.
the
book
begins
with
a
scene
from
richard
attenborough
s
1982
film
"
gandhi
"
,
what
wagner
cites
as
the
most
popular
depiction
of
the
jallianwalla
bagh
massacre
and
how
many
people
today
think
of
what
was
arguably
the
bloodiest
massacre
in
the
history
of
the
british
empire
.
according
to
wagner
,
understanding
the
massacre
requires
beginning
with
the
indian
rebellion
of
1857
.
in
1919
,
the
continuing
fear
of
a
revolution
led
to
the
proposal
of
the
suppressive
rowlatt
act
which
would
give
the
british
powers
to
quash
any
political
agitation
,
and
contradicted
the
simultaneous
british
promises
with
the
indian
national
congress
to
give
greater
involvement
to
indians
in
government
.
mahatma
gandhi
responded
by
proposing
that
all
indians
oppose
the
act
and
make
a
satyagraha
pledge
,
a
promise
to
resist
without
using
violence
.
the
subsequent
call
for
general
strikes
in
late
march
1919
then
led
to
the
arrest
of
two
local
indian
leaders
.
on
10
april
1919
,
upon
hearing
of
the
arrests
,
a
crowd
of
indians
issued
a
petition
for
the
release
of
their
leaders
.
when
british
officials
panicked
and
fired
in
reaction
to
seeing
the
approaching
crowd
,
riots
erupted
.
on
that
day
,
wagner
explained
,
european
civilians
had
been
killed
by
indian
rioters
,
and
white
women
had
been
attacked
by
brown
men
,
for
the
first
time
since
1857
.
the
british
subsequently
banned
all
future
gatherings
.
however
,
the
ban
was
not
widely
acknowledged
and
many
either
unaware
of
the
proclamation
or
not
believing
that
the
british
would
actually
resort
to
violence
,
proceeded
to
announce
a
meeting
at
the
jallianwala
bagh
that
would
take
place
on
april
13
,
1919
.
the
crowd
at
jallianwalla
bagh
was
composed
of
mainly
men
and
many
from
out
of
town
,
making
up
to
20
,
000
people
,
who
had
mostly
come
to
celebrate
a
religious
festival
.
speeches
focussed
on
the
rowlatt
act
,
the
call
to
release
the
two
arrested
local
indian
leaders
,
and
effects
on
indians
of
the
first
world
war
.
in
wagner
'
s
words
"
on
the
13th
of
april
,
1919
,
there
was
nobody
in
jallianwala
bagh
who
thought
about
independence
.
they
were
not
heroic
freedom
fighters
.
they
still
had
an
abiding
belief
in
the
ultimate
justice
of
the
raj
,
and
they
still
thought
of
the
british
government
as
being
the
arbiter
of
justice
"
.
when
general
dyer
arrived
"
he
was
overwhelmed
by
the
sheer
size
of
the
gathering
that
he
had
walked
in
on
"
and
assumed
it
was
a
rebellion
.
wagner
explains
that
the
british
response
was
of
"
racialized
fear
and
violent
suppression
"
.
afterwards
,
there
was
no
british
help
with
removing
the
dead
or
medical
assistance
for
the
injured
.
instead
,
the
british
authorities
imposed
curfews
,
a
crawling
order
and
martial
law
and
those
suspected
of
being
involved
in
the
10
april
riots
were
arrested
and
tortured
.
british
censorship
ensured
suppression
of
the
details
of
the
amritsar
troubles
and
the
massacre
,
until
october
1919
.
in
july
1920
,
the
matter
was
discussed
in
the
house
of
commons
.
some
noted
the
un
-
english
nature
of
what
happened
and
took
his
actions
as
a
"
blemish
on
an
otherwise
untarnished
british
rule
"
.
others
saw
dyer
'
s
actions
as
necessary
.
using
primary
sources
to
gather
evidence
,
wagner
has
clarified
that
the
book
aims
to
dispel
a
number
of
myths
surrounding
the
events
of
the
massacre
in
amritsar
on
13
april
1919
.
contrary
to
a
number
of
widely
held
beliefs
,
wagner
'
s
research
reveals
500
to
600
is
a
more
likely
plausible
estimate
of
the
number
killed
at
the
bagh
on
13
april
1919
,
and
that
eyewitness
accounts
recall
only
one
or
two
bodies
as
having
been
recovered
from
the
well
inside
the
park
.
that
number
,
however
,
he
says
,
does
not
"
actually
change
the
enormity
of
what
happened
"
.
in
2019
,
coinciding
with
the
100th
anniversary
of
the
massacre
at
jallianwalla
bagh
,
the
book
triggered
responses
in
a
number
of
publications
including
"
the
spectator
"
by
william
dalrymple
,
who
noted
that
wagner
had
used
extensive
primary
sources
in
his
research
and
"
almost
every
sentence
is
footnoted
gets
as
close
as
we
are
ever
likely
to
get
to
the
truth
of
what
happened
in
jallianwalla
bagh
.
in
the
process
,
he
demolishes
a
large
number
of
myths
that
have
grown
up
around
the
event
,
both
imperial
and
nationalist
"
.
andrew
lycett
,
writing
in
"
the
telegraph
"
,
described
the
book
as
having
skilfully
mapped
out
the
events
.
reporting
in
"
the
times
"
,
tunku
varadarajan
agreed
with
wagner
that
the
book
is
a
"
a
microhistory
of
a
global
event
"
,
aimed
at
neither
those
with
"
raj
nostalgia
or
indian
nationalism
"
.
these
responses
were
also
supported
by
john
newsinger
.
however
,
newsinger
,
with
regards
to
the
fear
of
another
1857
,
pointed
out
"
one
disagreement
with
wagner
'
s
discussion
of
this
is
that
on
occasions
it
[
the
book
]
seems
to
suggest
that
the
massacre
was
the
result
of
a
misunderstanding
,
that
if
the
british
had
not
been
so
obsessed
with
the
events
of
the
1850s
then
the
massacre
might
never
have
taken
place
"
.
trevor

the
book
be
taught
at

and
colleges
.
ferdinand

,
noted
that

evidence
is
quoted
at
length
in

both

.
mount
argued
that
wagner
had
underplayed
the
personality
of
general
dyer
,
portraying
him
as
"
nothing
exceptional
.
.
.
and
nothing
extraordinary
"
,
instead
emphasising
that
it
was
"
brutality
"
in
general
that
was
the
"
driving
principle
of
the
raj
"
rather
than
the
personality
of
individuals
.
wagner
responded
to
mount
'
s
view
that
"
dyer
and
the
massacre
were
unique
"
and
that
the
massacre
"
was
all
down
to

personality
of

by
citing
the
other
brutal
incidents

,
born

au
-
perche
(

.
after
having
been
controller
of
the
port
of

twenty
years
,
gilles

advanced

notably
by
granting
seigneuries
in
the
region

,
steward
of
the
port
of
brest
and
,
as
such
,
he
remained

several
historians

entirely

noted
for

comic
effects
and
has
been
described
as
one
of
the
"
weirdest
"
and
most
novel
releases
of
its
type
.
the
album
came
about
when
two
artists
,
jeff
st
.
pierre
and
philip
antoniades
,
found
themselves
bored
one
evening
at

office

music
out

bands

staplers
,
tape
and
other
office
supplies
to
hand

after
entertaining
themselves
through
the
night
with
this
diversion
,
they
forwarded
the
results
as
a
"
seasonal
thank
you
"
to
friends
and
associates
.
the
recording
was
sufficiently
well
received
that
artist
development
associates
of

,

,
decided
to
release
it
as
a
cd
,
under

title
"

going

the

the

fourteen
tracks
typically
feature

popular
christmas
carols

with

substituted
at
some
point

states
that
in

of
the
unusual
instrumentation
,
the
tracks
are
"
still
recognizable
as
and
a
whole
lot
sillier
than
the
original
carols
.
"
the
reviewer
concludes
that
while
the
14
tracks
"
may
be
too
much
of
a
good
thing
"
,
the
release
constitutes
"
easily
the

in

much
of
our

with

[
was

that
you
had

"
according
to
syrian
kurdish

,
the
deal
allowed
syrian
government
forces
to
take
over
security
in
some
border
areas
,
but
their
own
administration
would
maintain
control
of

key
towns
in
northeastern
syria
,
including
manbij
,
tell
tamer
,
kobanî
,
and

and
took
up
position
in
some
areas
to
oppose
turkish

that

the

was

and
stated
that

was

between

russia

made
an
agreement
via
the

to
set
up

syrian

they
said
their
focus
would

.
on
30
october
,
the
recently
-
negotiated
syrian
constitutional
committee
held
its
inaugural
meeting
.
in
november
2019
,
refugees
in
northeast
syria
reported
they
had
received
no
help
from
international
aid
organizations
.
on
20
november
2019
,
a
new
syrian
constitutional
committee
,
with
about
150
members
,
began
discussing
a
new
settlement
and
to
draft
a
new
constitution
for
syria
.
the
committee
includes
representatives
of
the
syrian
government
,
opposition
groups
,
and
countries
serving
as
guarantors
of
the
process
such
as
russia
.
however
,
this
committee
has
faced
strong
opposition
from
the
syrian
government
.
50
of
the
committee
members
represent
the
assad
government
,
and
50
members
represent
the
opposition
.
the
committee
began
working
in
november
2019
in
geneva
,
under
un
auspices
.
however
,
the
syrian
government
delegation
left
on
the
second
day
of
the
process
.
on
24
november
,
pro
-
government
forces
launched
a
new
idlib
offensive
,
the
largest
offensive
by
the
syrian
government
in
idlib
in
more
than
three
months
.
russia
and
syria
escalated
their
attacks
against
rebel
forces
in
idlib
.
this
was
criticized
by
the
united
states
and
u
.
s
.
president
donald
trump
issued
a
warning
against
violence
against
civilians
in
idlib
.
a
new
international
issue
emerged
when
syrian
forces
reached
the
area
of
various
turkish
outposts
,
and
erdogan
said
that
turkish
forces
would
not
withdraw
from
any
position
.
syrian
troops
closed
in
on
the
town
of
maaret
al
-
numan
.
on
december
30
,
2019
,
the
us
launched
air
strikes
in
syria
against
rebel
groups
allied
with
iran
.
it
appeared
that
turkey
was
withdrawing
all
of
its
forces
away
from
the
al
-
shirkark
silos
,
which
hold
important
supplies
of
wheat
,
this
seemed
to
be
a
result
of
russian
mediation
.
however
,
some
reports
said
they
later
returned
to
re
-
occupy
that
area
.
russia
said
it
would
pledge
to
remove
turkish
forces
from
a
key
highway
in
northern
syria
,
and
replace
them
with
russian
forces
to
maintain
stability
.
russian
and
turkish
forces
are
continuing
their
joint
patrols
.
questions
remained
about
how
much
control
turkey
has
over
its
proxies
,
such
as
the
free
syrian
army
.
turkey
has
begun
to
appoint
local
mayors
and
governors
in
several
northern
syrian
towns
.
they
have
also
appointed
about
4
,
000
police
officers
and
other
local
officials
,
and
are
providing
some
basic
local
services
for
citizens
.
there
are
some
reports
that
turkey
has
become
more
involved
with
local
infrastructure
in
areas
that
it
controls
.
some
local
schools
have
been
provided
with
some
teachers
and
curriculum
components
.
erdogan
said
that
turkey
expects
to
resettle
about
1
million
refugees
in
that
a
rea
,
and
called
for
more
support
from
the
eu
and
from
world
organizations
.
some
protesters
in
syria
blamed
turkey
for
the
latest
syrian
attacks
on
idlib
.
they
claim
that
the
rebel
groups
posted
near
idlib
are
largely
akin
to
mercenary
groups
answering
to
turkey
.
it
is
unclear
whether
there
is
strong
evidence
for
this
allegation
.
meanwhile
,
as
turkey
considers
sending
some
elements
of
these
groups
to
libya
,
it
heightens
such
allegations
.
a
major
statement
from
ngo
act
alliance
found
that
millions
of
syrian
refugees
remain
displaced
in
countries
around
syria
.
this
includes
around
1
.
5
million
refugees
in
lebanon
.
also
the
report
found
that
refugees
in
camps
in
north
-
eastern
syria
have
tripled
this
year
.
the
unhcr
has
also
been
tracking
data
on
refugees
,
and
maintains
an
official
website
to
do
so
.
numerous
refugees
remain
in
local
refugee
camps
.
conditions
there
are
reported
to
be
severe
,
especially
with
winter
approaching
.
4
,
000
people
are
housed
at
the
washokani
camp
.
no
organizations
are
assisting
them
other
than
the
kurdish
red
cross
.
numerous
camp
residents
have
called
for
assistance
from
international
groups
.
over
120
,
000
refugees
were
reported
fleeing
idlib
governorate
.
in
december
2019
,
erdogan
stated
that
syrian
bombing
of
idlib
had
caused
new
waves
of
refugees
to
enter
turkey
,
also
stated
that
turkey
could
not
handle
this
new
influx
,
and
that
this
influx
would
be
"
be
"
felt
by
all
european
countries
"
.
the
un
said
235
,
0000
refugees
have
fled
the
area
.
turkey
is
reaching
out
to

to
try
to
mitigate
the
situation
.

would
ask

various
kurdish

that

their
stated

come
up
with

various

blamed

the

they
expressed
willingness

have
positive

meetings
between

went
well
,
and
all
parties
agreed
on

at
a
panel
discussion
on
the
conflict
in
december
2019
,
several
experts
said
the
conflict
was
slowly
moving
towards
resolution
.
one
expert
said
that
the
"
astana
"
diplomatic
process
,
involving
turkey
,
russia
,
and
iran
,
was
having
some
positive
results
.

also
said
that
bashar
assad
had
made
progress
in
restoring
rule
by
local
councils
in
areas
affected
by
the
conflict
.
in
december
2019
,
the
eu
held
an
international
conference
which
condemned
any
suppression
of
the
kurds
,
and
called
for
the
self
-
declared
automnomous
administration
in
rojava
to
be
preserved
and
to
be
reflected
in
any
new
syrian
constitution
.
the
kurds
are
concerned
that
the
independence
of
their
declared
autonomous
administration
of
north
and
east
syria
(
nes
)
in
rojava
might
be
severely
curtailed
.
the
united
states
announced
it
will
pass
major
new
sanctions
against
syria
and
russia
,
as
well
as
iran
,
reportedly
due
to
alleged
war
crimes
committed
during
the
civil
war
.
the
us
congress
has
enacted
punitive
sanctions
on
the
syrian
government
for
its
actions
during
the
civil
war
.
these
sanctions
would
penalize
any
entities
lending
support
to
the
syrian
government
,
and
any
companies
operating
in
syria
.
us
president
donald
trump
tried
to
protect
the
turkish
president
erdogan
from
the
effect
of
such
sanctions
.
some
activists
welcomed
this
legislation
.
some
critics
noted
that
these
punitive
sanctions
are
likely
to
backfire
or
have
unintended
consequences
;
i
.
e
.
,
instead
of
impeding
or
curtailing
the
syrian
government
,
it
will
increase
its
authority
,
as
ordinary
syrian
people
will
now
have
less
economic
resources
due
to
these
sanctions
,
and
will
need
to
rely
on
the
syrian
government
and
its
economic
allies
and
projects
even
more
.
critics
said
that
such
economic
sanctions
have
little
realistic
chance
of
promoting
real
reform
and
democracy
;
their
impact
on
the
political
ruling
class
will
be
limited
,
while
they
will
likely
affect
ordinary
syrians
disproportionately
.
mohammed
al
-
abdallah
,
executive
director
of
syria
justice
and
accountability
center
(
sjac
)
,
said
that
the
sanctions
will
likely
hurt
ordinary
syrian
people
,
saying
,
it
is
an
almost
unsolvable
unfeasible
equation
.
if
they
are
imposed
,
they
will
indirectly
harm
the
syrian
people
,
and
if
they
are
lifted
,
they
will
indirectly
revive
the
syrian
regime
;
he
attributed
the
sanctions
to
political
considerations
,
as
the
united
states
does
not
have
weapons
and
tools
in
the
syrian
file
,
and
sanctions
are
its
only
means
.

ambassador

,
said
"
.
.
.
going

,
we
re
seeing

it
seems
that
the
us
,
having
failed
to
change
the
regime
in
syria
by
military
force
or
by
proxies
,
is
tightening
the
economic
screws
and
the
main
reason
why
the
us
is
keeping
hold
of
the
production
facilities
in
eastern
syria
.
so
,
the
economic
situation
is
becoming
more
and
more
serious
and
dire
in
syria
and
it
s
a
major
reason
why
refugees
are
not
going
back
.
in
the
kurdish
-
led
autonomous

in

eastern
syrian
(

of
rojava
,
kurdish
opposition
parties
have
refused
to
re

open
their
offices
.
they
have
cited
a
lack
of
trust
in
the
regional
government
of
rojava
.
meanwhile
,
officials
of
the
nes
held
meetings
with
local
arab
leaders
,
who
stated
that
kurdish
forces
are
unfairly
detaining
women
and
children
from
their
communities
.
at
the
nato
summit
in
london
in
december
2019
,
president
emmanuel
macron
of
france
highlighted
major
differences
with
turkey
over
the
definition
of
terrorism
,
and
said
there
was
little
chance
this
aspect
of
the
conflict
could
be
resolved
positively
.
macron
criticized
turkey
strongly
for
fighting
against
groups
who
had
been
allied
with
france
and
the
west
in
fighting
terrorism
.
numerous
issues
in
resolving
the
conflict
emerged
at
the
nato
summit
in
london
.
turkey
proposed
a
safe
zone
where
syrian
refugees
could
be
relocated
,
but
this
idea
did
not
receive
support
from
all
parties
.
prior
to
the
nato
summit
,
there
was
a
meeting
at
10
downing
street
of
the
leaders
of
france
,
the
uk
,
germany
and
turkey
.
one
key
point
that
emerged
that
the
western
countries
insisted
that
refugees
could
only
be
relocated
voluntarily
.
meanwhile
,
there
were
concerns
in
nato
about
turkey
'
s
growing
closeness
with
russia
.
erdogan
claimed
that
a
four

way
summit
on
syria
was
scheduled
to
occur
in

in

to
include

at

russian

officials
clearly
stated
their
support
for
syria
regaining
control
over
all
of
its
territory
.
the

also
expressed
official
support
for

a
new
round
of
meetings
for
the
astana
summit
process
took
place
in
the
kazakh
capital
nur
sultan
.
the
meeting
includes
russia
,
syria
,
turkey
and
iran
.
at
this
meeting
russia
,
stated
that
the
"
safe
zone
"
established
by
turkey
should
not
be
expanded
,
as
this
would
not
accomplish
anything
positive
for
the
region
.
the
astana
process
was
created
by
turkey
,
iran
and
russia
in
order
to
find
a
lasting
solution
to
the
conflict
.
they
have
examined
a
process
to
reform
the
constitution
of
syria
via
the
newly

formed

constitutional
committee

the
parties
reported
that
they
reached
some
important
understandings
at
this
meeting
,
including
affirming
a
commitment
to
work
together
to
respect
syrian
territorial
integrity
.
the
united
states
has
boycotted
this
process
.
at
the
astana
process
meeting
in
december
2019
,
a
un
official
stated
that
in
order
for
the
third
round
of
talks
to
proceed
,
co
-
chairs
from
the
assad
regime
and
the
opposition
need
to
agree
on
an
agenda
.
the
committee
has
two
co
-
chairs
,
ahmad
kuzbari
representing
the
assad
regime
,
and
hadi
albahra
from
the
opposition
.
it
is
unclear
if
the
third
round
of
talks
will
proceed
on
a
firm
schedule
,
until
the
assad
regime
provides
its
assent
to
participate
.
the
arab
league
has
offered
to
allow
syria
to
rejoin
as
a

.
they
have
stipulated
two
pre

conditions
for
doing
so
;
firstly
,
that
syria
distance
itself
from
iran
,
and
,
secondly
that
syria
implement
un

resolution

,
which
calls
for
the
a
process
to
reform
the

seductive
"

back
"
the
flirtatious
bieber
we
'
ve
missed
and
been
waiting
for
"
,
describing
the
chorus
as
"
catchy
"
.
bryan
rolli
,
writing
for

,
said
that
bieber
"
sings
his
heart
out
"
on
the
song
and
noted
although
"
the
lyrics
may
not
invite
scholarly
analysis
.
.
.
bieber
sure
does
sound
good
singing
them
"
.
rolli
concluded
calling
the
song
a
"
win
,
an
inevitable
chart
smash
"
and
opined
that
it
is
"
sure
to
sound
even
better
when
50
,

fans
scream
it
every
night
on
his
upcoming
tour
"
.
mikael
wood
of
"
los
angeles
times
"
described
the
song
as
"
a
lithe
little
r
&
b
number
that
faintly
recalls
ginuwine
'
s
mid
-
'
90s
classic
'
pony
'
and
basically
three
-
and
-
a
-
half
minutes
of
pg
-

sex
talk
seemingly
directed
at
hailey
baldwin
"
.
he
stated
that
"
though
it
'
s
very
cute
,
'
yummy
'
feels
awfully
lightweight
for
a
single
that
has
as
much
hanging
on
it
as
this
one
does
"
and
added
that
the
song
"
loses
much
of
its
flavor
after
only
a
few
spins
"
.
brad
callas
of
"
complex
"
magazine
listed
"
yummy
"
amongst
the
best
new
music
of
the
week
and
said
bieber
'
s
"
pivot
back

who
were

"
.
callas
further
remarked
that
the
"

is
at
times
reminiscent
of
bieber

s
2016
collaboration
with
post

,
"

.
"
nme
"
s
sam
moore
complimented
the
song
'
s
r
&
b
production
,
but
dismissed
the
lyrics
,
which
he
termed
as
"
failed
expectations
"
.
he
opined
that
the
song
'
s
producers
opted
for
"
minimalism
with
their
choice
of
instrumentation
,
melding
airy
keys
with
pop
-
trap
beats
with
an
evident
view
of
creating
something
as
universal
as
the
likes
of
'
hotline
bling
'
and
childish
gambino
'
s
'
feels
like
summer
'
"
.
moore
further
wrote
that
bieber
'
s
layered
vocals
and
harmonies
are
"
able
to
glide
along
rather
effortlessly
it
'
s
just
a
shame
he
doesn
'
t
have
more
to
say
with
them
"
and
that
bieber
'

embrace
of
r

b
"
isn
'

a
complete
turn

off

"
s
eric
torres
criticized
the
song
for
being
"
shamelessly
engineered
for
the
truncated
attention
span
of
tiktok
"
and
"
a
bloodless
shell
of
an
r
&
b
song
crippled
by
asinine
lyrics
and
a
tired
,
syncopated
backdrop
"
.
he
further
wrote
that
the
song
"
plateaus
as
soon
as
it
starts
,
never
inching
past
the
toddler
-
like
repetition
of
'
yummy

'
in
its

the

wrote
that
"

is
"

doesn

royal
irish
regiment
of

guards
the
royal
irish
regiment
of
foot
guards
,
or
"
his
majesty
s
regiment
of
guards
in
ireland
"
,
was
a
regiment
of
foot
guards
first
raised
in
1662
for
service
in
ireland
.
part
of
the
royal
irish
army
of
charles
ii
,
it
was
initially
garrisoned
around
dublin
.
during
the
1688
glorious
revolution
the
foot
guards
under
their
commanding
officer
william
dorrington
stayed
loyal
to
james
ii
,
and
fought
on
the
jacobite
side
in
the
williamite
war
in
ireland
.
after
the
1697
peace
of
ryswick
and
the
formal
disestablishment
of
james
s
army
in
exile
,
the
foot
guards
were
immediately
reconstituted
in
french
service
as
dorrington
s
regiment
,
retaining
their
red
coats
and
saint
george
'
s
cross
standard
.
as
part
of
the
irish
brigade
they
distinguished
themselves
in
a
number
of
campaigns
.
renamed
the
regiment
roth
after
a
subsequent
colonel
,
michael
roth
,
and
later
still
as
the
regiment
walsh
,
the
regiment
did
not
formally
disband
until
1791
.
charles
ii
issued
the
order
for
the
regiment
'
s
creation
in
april
1662
,
soon
after
the
restoration
.
the
remainder
of
the
7
,
500
-
strong
army
formed
in
ireland
at
this
point
was
not
formally
regimented
until
the
1670s
,
and
contained
many
cromwellian
veterans
.
leading
royalist
james
butler
,
1st
duke
of
ormond
was
given
the
commission
to
raise
the
regiment
and
authority
to
appoint
junior
officers
;
the
experienced
anglo
-
irish
soldier
sir
william
flower
was
made
lieutenant
-
colonel
,
while
ormonde
s
son
richard
butler
,
1st
earl
of
arran
was
gazetted
colonel
,
with
captaincy
of
a
company
.
other
commissions
were
given
to
members
of
ormonde
'
s
circle
such
as
sir
nicholas
armorer
and
sir
john
stephens
of
finglas
.
the
regiment
was
initially
established
at
1200
men
in
12
companies
,
plus
officers
;
it
also
included
a
chaplain
,
surgeon
,
drum
-
major
and
24
drummers
along
with
a
piper
to
the
"
king
'
s
company
"
.
many
of
the
rank
and
file
were
raised
in
england
,
apparently
to
minimise
cromwellian
influence
,
with
further
recruits
from
the
ranks
of
the
irish
independent
companies
.
up
until
1688
members
of
the
guards
were
quartered
either
in
dublin
castle
or
in
the
city
gatehouses
.
under
arran
,
the
guards
were
employed
largely
on
peacetime
duties
in
ireland
:
they
were
used
to
suppress
a
mutiny
by
other
regiments
in
carrickfergus
in
1666
,
while
in
1673
two
companies
were
ordered
to
chester
and
saw
service
on
board
ship
during
the
third
anglo
-
dutch
war
.
nevertheless
the
regiment
retained
a
high
prestige
:
a
major
billingsley
recorded
that
"
to
be
a
major
of
the
royal
regiment
of
guards
is
better
and
more
honourable
than
to
be
a
lieutenant
-
colonel
of
any
other
regiment
"
,
while
the
lord
lieutenant
of
ireland
,
clarendon
,
wrote
approvingly
of
their
appearance
on
parade
.
for
the
first
twenty
years
of
its
history
the
regiment
was
almost
exclusively
protestant
,
with
most
of
its
officers
drawn
from
the
irish
protestant
gentry
.
however
the
1685
accession
of
charles
s
catholic
brother
james
accelerated
the
recruitment
of
catholics
,
particularly
as
officers
.
james
s
associate
richard
talbot
,
1st
earl
of
tyrconnell
replaced
a
number
of
the
rank
and
file
,
giving
the
pretext
that
the
king
would
have
all
his
men
young
and
of
one
size
;
veteran
lieutenant
-
colonel
sir
charles
feilding
was
replaced
by
william
dorrington
,
an
english
catholic
.
dorrington
continued
reforming
the
regiment
,
though
clarendon
criticised
him
for
recruiting
at
the
catholic
shrine
st
james
'
s
well
,
feeling
it
would
harm
relations
with
the
catholic
community
.
arran
died
in
1686
and
his
nephew
james
,
lord
ossory
,
later
the
2nd
duke
of
ormonde
was
briefly
made
colonel
of
the
guards
:
at
the
time
of
the
glorious
revolution
,
ormonde
switched
his
allegiance
to
william
of
orange
.
he
was
replaced
as
colonel
by
dorrington
and
the
majority
of
the
regiment
stayed
loyal
to
james
,
although
one
of
its
two
battalions
,
sent
to
england
immediately
prior
to
william
'
s
landing
,
was
taken
prisoner
.
the
guards
subsequently
fought
on
the
jacobite
side
in
the
war
in
ireland
,
including
at
the
siege
of
derry
,
the
battle
of
the
boyne
and
at
aughrim
,
where
their
lieutenant
-
colonel
william
mansfield
barker
was
killed
.
several
hundred
of
their
number
were
among
those
permitted
to
leave
for
france
after
the
jacobite
defeat
.
following
their
departure
,
there
would
be
no
irish
guards
regiment
until
the
formation
of
the
irish
guards
in
1900
.
in
france
the
regiment
continued
to
recruit
from
among
irish
jacobite
exiles
,
the
so
-
called
wild
geese
,
and
saw
further
service
in
the
nine
years
'
war
.
the
terms
of
the
peace
of
ryswick
included
the
disbandment
of
james
s
former
army
,
but
the
same
day
as
the
guards
regiment
was
broken
up
,
27
february
1698
,
it
was
immediately
reconstituted

the

continued
in
french
service
in
several
campaigns

.
in
2018
haswell
was
part
of
the
team
that
was
first
to
identify
a
planet
around
barnard
'
s
star
,
the
closest
single
(
non
-
binary
)
star
to
earth
,
a
red
dwarf
star
that
is
six
light
years
away
from
earth
.
using
the
radial
velocity
method
,
the
team
discovered
barnard
'
s
star
b
.
the
solar
system
around
barnard
'
s
star
touches
on
the
edge
of
the
oort
cloud
.
barnard
'
s
star
b
has
a
mass
three
times
that
of
earth
and
orbits
barnard
'
s
star
in
233
days
.
haswell
has
predicted
that
the
planet
may
have
a
similar
surface
temperature
to
europa
.
in
2019
haswell
used
the
high
accuracy
radial
velocity
planet
searcher
(
harps
)
to
discover
six
extraordinarily
hot
exoplanets
(
with
surface
temperatures
between
1100
and
1800
c
)
.
at
temperatures
this
high
the
atmosphere
and
surface
levels
of
the
planet
can
be
lost
,
and
the
materials
disperse
into
a
thin
sheet
of
gas
.
the
gas
filters
the
light
from
nearby
stars
,
which
allowed
haswell
and
colleagues
to
study
the
chemical
composition
of
the
atmosphere
of
the
gas
sheet
.
the
planets
have
masses
equivalent
to
2
.
6
times
the
mass
of
the
earth
with
almost
half
the
mass
of
jupiter
.
haswell
has
proposed
that
these
planets
could
be
used
to
understand
the
geology
of
the
rocky
planets
in
earth
'
s
solar
system

alnön
old
church
(
)
is
a
medieval
church
on
the
island
of
alnön
,
sundsvall
municipality
,
sweden
.
the
oldest
part
of
the
church
probably
originates
from
the
13th
century
.
the
church
is
mentioned
in
1314
as
subordinate
to
skön
,
and
alnön
became
its
own
pastorate
only
in
1892
.
it
is
thought
that
the
sacristy
and
the
cemetery
were
built
in
the
15th
century
.
in
1778
,
a
wooden
porch
was
added
.
the
windows
in
the
southern
and
eastern
walls
were
enlarged
in
the
18th
century
.
it
was
built
by
local
inhabitants
.
by
1863
,
the
church
became
too
small
,
and
alnön
new
church
was
built
nearby
.
after
that
,
the
old
church
was
disused
and
only
restored
in
the
1927
under
direction
of
erik
salvén
.
medieval
frescoes
from
around
1500
have
been
preserved
.
the
church
used
to
keep
a
wooden
baptismal
font
made
in
the
13th
century
,
however
,
it
has
been
moved
to
the
new
church
.
the
weathercock
on

of

church
was
voted
in

to
be

cock
of

building

(
also
known
as
the
crown
of
roses
in
some
english
-
language
sources
)
is
a
composition
by
pyotr
ilyich
tchaikovsky
.
originally
written
in
1883
as
a
song
for
solo
voice
and
piano
,
it
was
subsequently
arranged
by
tchaikovsky
for
solo
voice
and
orchestra
(
1884
)
,
and
then
for
unaccompanied
choir
(
1889
)
.
the
words
are
based
on
the
poem
"
roses
and
thorns
"
by
american
poet
richard
henry
stoddard
,
originally
published
in
"
graham
'
s
magazine
"
of
may
1856
.
stoddard
'
s
poem
was
translated
into
russian
by
the
poet
,
aleksey
pleshcheyev
and
published
in
the
russian
journal
"
sem
'
ia
i
shkola
"
(
"
family
and
school
"
)
in
1877
.
pleshcheyev
described
the
origin
of
the
poem
only
as
"
translated
from
the
english
"
,
without
crediting
stoddard
,
the
nature
of
whose
contribution
was
thus
lost
.
the
poem
was
included
in
pleshcheyev
'
s
anthology
"
snowdrop
"
(
подснeжник
;
1878
)
,
where
it
was
found
by
tchaikovsky
.
when
"
legend
"
is
sung
by
english
-
speaking
choirs
,
the
words
used
are
usually
those
of
geoffrey

translated
pleschcheyev
'
s
russian
text
back
into
english
for
the
"
english
carol
book
"
(
1913
)
.
dearmer
himself
was
only
20
years
old
when
he
wrote
the
words
.
while
pleshcheyev
'
s
russian
lyrics
are
a
literal
translation
of
stoddard
,
and
also
copy
the
original
rhyming
scheme
abcb
,
dearmer
uses
considerable
poetic
licence
and
a
new
rhyming
scheme
of
aabb
.
the
song
is
in
the
key
of
e
minor
,
but
the
lack
of
any
accidentals
in
the
melody
gives
it
a
modal
character
.
the
original
form
of
the
song
has
a
brief
piano
introduction
and
coda
.
this
is
retained
in
the
orchestral
arrangement
.
in
the
choral
arrangement
,
the
introduction
is
eliminated
,
and
the
piano
coda
is
replaced
by
a
choral
coda
featuring
extremely
low
basses
.

it

hay

was
once
part

royal
park
,
an
early
landowner
being
edward

the
area
once
belonged
to
the
crown
;
then
edward

gave
it
to
his
favourite
,
piers
gaveston
.
after
gaveston
was
executed
,
it
passed
back
to
the
crown
,
but
was
subject
to
poaching
for
some
time
.
in
the
14th

the
area
was
known
as

henry

conferred
the

slingsby
,
died
falling
from
his
horse
into
the
river
in

,
leaving
no
issue
.
the
area
later
became
known
as
"
haya
park
"
.
by
the
seventeenth
century
the
land
was
at

partly
wooded
,
and
managed
for
timber
.
by
the
end
of
that
century
it
was
owned
by
lady
hewley
,
who
used
its
rents
to
support
the
church

charities
.
when
its
farmland
was
valued
in
1755
by
robert
moody
of
york
,
the
land
was
considered
potentially
good
for
cultivation
,
but
contemporary
farmers
were
"
poor
idle
drunken
ignorant
fellows
"
who
spent
sundays
in
the
alehouse
;
so
that
the
land
was
"
miserably
run

full
of
weeds
,
"
with
no
prospect
of
land
improvement
.
in

the

which
took
place
on

stadium
in
luque
,
paraguay
,
to
determine
the
winners
of
the
2019
fifa
beach
soccer
world
cup
.
it
was
the
final
and
hence
the
last
match
of
the
10th
fifa
beach
soccer
world
cup
,
a
biennial
competition
contested
by
the
men
'
s
national
teams
of
the
member
associations
of
fifa
.
as
the
fourth
all
-
european
final
(
following
2001
,
2005
and
2013
)
,
the
match
pitted
the
european
champions
of
2018
and
2019
respectively
against
each
other
:
italy
,
who
had
previously
competed
in
one
world
cup
final
,
in
2008
,
and
portugal
,
who
appeared
in
their
third
fifa
beach
soccer
world
cup
final
and
their
sixth
overall
when
taking
into
account
the
pre
-
fifa
era
"
beach
soccer
world
championships
"
;
their
last
appearance
was
four
years
prior
in
2015
.
in
what
was
seen
as
an
evenly
contested
affair
,
portugal
emerged
as
victors
thanks
to
a
series
of
successful
free
kicks
,
clinching
the
match
by
six
goals
to
four
to
win
their
second
fifa
beach
soccer
world
cup
crown
(
following
2015
)
and
third
world
title
overall
(
including
success
in
the
2001
world
championship
)
,
condemning
italy
to
a
second
runners
-
up
medal
.
the
match
was
also
notable
as
the
583rd
and
final
international
beach
soccer
appearance
of
madjer
;
the
portuguese
captain
,
often
hailed
as
the
best
player
of
all
-
time
,
announced
his
retirement
immediately
following
the
match
.
italian
captain
,
francesco
corosiniti
,
also
retired
following
the
match
,
his
263rd
cap
.
both
nations
are
veterans
at
world
cups
,
with
portugal
missing
only
one
and
italy
,
two
,
since
their
debuts
(
1997
and
1995
respectively
)
.
the
former
had
had
considerably
more
success
than
the
latter
.
during
the
"
world
championships
"
era
,
portugal
became
champions
in
2001
and
finished
on
the
podium
a
further
four
times
(
1999
,
2002
,
2003
,
2004
)
.
since
the
fifa
era
began
,
portugal
have
fared
relatively
similarly
,
winning
the
2015
title
,
finishing
as
runners
-
up
in
2005
and
earning
bronze
medals
three
times
(
2008
,
2009
,
2011
)
.
this
was
portugal
'
s
third
fifa
final
and
sixth
overall
.
italy
'
s
best
finish
of
the
world
championships
was
a
single
bronze
medal
,
in
1996
.
italy
reached
their
first
final
during
the
fifa
era
in
2008
,
when
they
lost
to
brazil
5
3
,
and
this
remained
their
only
podium
finish
of
this
era
until
now
.
this
was
italy
'
s
second
world
cup
final
.
however
,
more
recently
,
after
neither
team
qualified
for
2013
,
italy
had
reached
the
semi
-
finals
of
the
last
two
editions
,
one
better
than
their
iberian
opponents
.
both
teams
had
enjoyed
generally
successful
seasons
but
not
without
some
negatives
.
as
european
nations
,
they
had
competed
in
many
of
the
same
events
.
portugal
failed
in
qualification
for
the
world
beach
games
,
but
compensated
for
this
disappointment
by
claiming
the
gold
medal
at
the
european
games
and
becoming
six
-
time
european
champions
at
the
euro
beach
soccer
league
(
ebsl
)
.
despite
reaching
this
final
,
they
narrowly
qualified
for
the
world
cup
in
july
,
finishing
in
the
final
qualification
spot
,
but
also
won
the
silver
medal
at
the
mediterranean
beach
games
.
portugal
were
world
ranked
4th
going
into
the
match
.
italy
went
into
the
season
as
reigning
european
champions
having
won
the
2018
ebsl
and
began
the
year
by
qualifying
for
the
world
beach
games
were
they
went
on
to
lose
to
iran
in
the
bronze
medal
match
.
they
only
managed
a
fifth
place
finish
at
the
european
games
,
but
claimed
fourth
in
the
ebsl
and
second
place
in
qualification
for
the
world
cup
.
the
mediterranean
beach
games
was
their
most
successful
event
,
where
they
claimed
the
gold
medal
.
italy
were
world
ranked
3rd
going
into
the
match
.
the
teams
had
gone
head
-
to
-
head
three
times
previously
at
world
cups
,
twice
during
the
world
championships
era
and
once
in
the
fifa
era
.
the
three
meetings
are
documented
below
:
the
teams
had
already
met
on
three
previous
occasions
in
2019
,
with
italy
winning
two
,
however
portugal
had
won
the
most
recent
contest
.
before
then
,
the
teams
had
not
clashed
for
over
two
years
.
however
,
overall
,
the
two
teams
had
met
48
times
previously
.
the
last
five
meetings
are
documented
in
the
below
table
:
period
one
began
with
portugal
on
the
offensive
and
italy
on
the
defensive
,
the
latter
'
s
style
compared
to
the
"
catenaccio
"
tactics
classically
used
by
their
national
football
team
.
hence
the
portuguese
were
the
team
creating
the
goal
-
scoring
opportunities
and
dominating
play
,
but
on
six
minutes
,
italy
scored
against
the
run
of
play
after
a
shot
from
madjer
(
portugal
'
s
twelfth
of
the
match
)
,
corosiniti
played
a
ball
through
the
middle
to
zurlo
who
slotted
home
italy
'
s
first
shot
of
the
match
.
90
seconds
later
,
chiavaro
fouled
leo
martins
up
against
the
touchline
,
just
outside
the
italian
penalty
area
.
the
portuguese
smashed
his
free
kick
into
the
bottom
left
hand
corner
to
equalise
the
score
.
portugal
continued
to
dominate
,
having
over
70
%
possession
of
the
ball
,
but
italy
began
creating
opportunities
of
their
own
as
the
period
neared
its
end
.
after
an
injury
timeout
following
corosiniti
and
belchior
'
s
clash
,
the
period
concluded
with
the
score
still
level
at
1
1
.
the
second
period
started
with
a
more
even
spread
of
chances
for
both
teams
.
del
mestre
was
forced
into
good
saves
from
jordan
and
then
be
martins
,
whilst
,
gori
and
zurlo
saw
their
free
kicks
go
narrowly
wide
for
italy
.
in
the
sixth
minute
,
the
deadlock
was
broken
.
leo
martins
won
possession
just
inside
his
own
half
and
lead
portugal
on
a
quick
counterattack
,
ultimately
squaring
the
ball
to
an
unmarked
jordan
in
the
middle
who
fired
home
at
the
edge
of
the
box
.
30
seconds
after
the
restart
,
jordan
won
a
long
-
range
free
kick
,
with
his
effort
saved
by
a
diving
del
mestre
.
however
,
the
italian
mistakenly
parried
the
ball
back
into
the
centre
of
the
box
;
with
the
goal
left
undefended
,
lourenço
pounced
onto
the
loose
ball
for
a
tap
in
,
putting
portugal
up
3
1
.
despite
the
two
goal
gap
,
the
game
remained
balanced
as
the
second
half
of
period
two
progressed
;
leo
martins
wasted
a
great
chance
,
a
one
-
on
-
one
opportunity
against
the
goalkeeper
,
shooting
wide
.
jordan
converted
a
powerful
free
kick
from
the
centre
of
the
pitch
during
the
opening
stages
of
period
three
to
open
up
a
4
1
lead
for
portugal
.
this
deficit
saw
italy
become
more
offensive
to
try
and
bridge
the
gap
.
one
minute
later
,
jordan
was
guilty
of
a
foul
on
gori
,
conceding
a
penalty
,
but
the
italian
'
s
spot
kick
attempt
was
saved
by
andrade
.
the
attacking
play
of
italy
began
opening
up
more
spaces
for
portugal
to
exploit
.
soon
after
,
leo
martins
completed
a
brace
from
a
free
kick
given
away
by
marinai
just
outside
the
italian
box
,
extending
the
portuguese
lead
to
5
1
with
just
eight
minutes
left
on
the
clock
.
protests
surrounding
the
foul
lead
to
a
flurry
of
yellow
cards
,
for
jordan
,
del
mestre
and
chiavaro
.
after
a
corosiniti
effort
hit
the
post
,
italy
scored
two
goals
inside
the
31st
minute
.
first
a
one

between

,
josep

from

to

in
at
the
back
post
for

,
reigniting
the
match
as

contest
,
seeing

take
a
more
cautious
approach
into
the
final
minutes
.

with

studied
mathematics

biology
at
the
university
of
paris
and
heidelberg
university
.
she
was
an
erasmus
programme
student
at

university
of
barcelona
.
amtmann
completed
her
graduate
degrees
in
biology
in
the
laboratory
of
at
the
university
of
göttingen
.
her
doctoral
research
involved
the
use
of
electrophysiology
to
study
unicellular
marine
algae
,
in
an
effort
to
understand
how
they
maintain
homeostasis
for
calcium
and
sodium
ions
.
in
1993
,
after
earning
her
phd
,
amtmann
investigated
ion
transport
properties
in
barley
in
dale
sanders
'
laboratory
at
the
university
of
york
.
whilst
at
york
she
developed
microarrays
that
could
be
used
to
monitor
how
ion
transporters
responded
to
nutrient
deficiency
and
salinity
.
amtmann
was
appointed
a

her
research
considers
the
mechanisms
by
which
plants
adapt
to
nutrient
deficiency
,
drought
and
salinity
.
she
has
explored
how
solar
-
powered
microorganisms
could
be
used
to
extra
salt
from
seawater
.
salt
is
toxic
in
seawater
because
it
causes
dehydration
in
cells
and
can
distort
the
shape
of
proteins
.
marine
organisms
have
developed
strategies
to
avoid
toxicity
,
and
amtmann
looks
to
identify
these
organisms
,
fit
them
with
molecular
engines
and
encourage
them
to
take
up
salt
until
they
are
saturated
with
salt
.
the
salt
-
packed
cells
will
die
and
can
be
removed
from
the
system
,
leaving
fresh
water
and
a
waste
product
that
can
be
used

war
ii
and
was
never
rebuilt
.
the
surfaces
of
the
building
are
damaged
from
the
bombs
and
subsequent
neglect
,
with
most
of
the
stucco
gone
.
during
world
war
ii
,
the
building
was
used
by
the
allgemeine
elektrizitäts
-
gesellschaft
(
the
general
electricity
company
)
to
house
french
forced
labourers
.
after
the
war
,
the
building
lay
in
east
berlin
.
under
the
german
democratic
republic
(
gdr
)
,
the
building
was
used
for
sports
activities
and
there
was
a
bowling
alley
in
the
basement
.
by
1990
,
it
had
become
vacant
and
was
scheduled
to
be
demolished
.
køpi
was
squatted
on
february
23
,
1990
,
by
autonomen
from
west
berlin
.
despite
the
terrible
state
of
the
building
,
the
squatters
were
attracted
by
the
large
rooms
.
the
police
did
not
attempt
to
evict
the
occupation
,
which
marked
the
first
time
people
from
west
berlin
had
squatted
in
east
berlin
.
the
squatters
legalised
their
occupation
with
the
district
council
of
mitte
in
1991
.
from
the
very
beginning
,
køpi
was
a
radical
left
space
where
anarchists
,
socialists
,
queers
and
musicians
were
welcome
.
the
building
itself
is
covered
in
banners
and
graffiti
.
it
became
known
as
køpi
because
the
squatters
chose
to
use
the
danish
"
ø
"
despite
the
name
coming
from
the
name
of
the
street
(
köpenicker
straße
)
.
køpi
is
also
spelt
koepi
,
köpi
and
even
occasionally
kopi
in
english
or
spanish
texts
.
køpi
has
become
a
important
symbol
for
the
radical
left
in
berlin
,
linked
to
projects
elsewhere
such
as
the
ungdomshuset
in
copenhagen
and
rozbrat
in
poznań
.
the
building
was
owned
by
the
gdr
and
then
by
the
state
which
succeeded
it
.
in
1995
,
the
government
sold
the
building
to
volquard
petersen
,
who
wished
to
develop
the
site
into
the
sun
courtyards
(
german
:
"
sonnenhöf
"
)
.
he
then
ran
out
of
money
and
the
project
was
shelved
.
petersen
fell
into
debt
with
the
commerzbank
and
the
building
was
foreclosed
.
in
1999
,
the
district
of
mitte
carried
out
a
forced
auction
.
the
auction
was
unsuccessful
with
none
of
almost
30
participants
offering
to
buy
the
property
,
which
had
an
estimated
value
of
5
.
4
million
marks
.
the
offer
of
køpi
residents
to
buy
the
building
for
one
mark
was
rejected
,
alongside
their
request
for
the
terrain
to
be
declared
a
'
special
use
site
for
experimental
living
'
(
german
:
"
sondernutzungsfläche
für
experimentelles
wohnen
"
)
.
in
the
meantime
,
the
residents
carried
out
essential
repairs
such
as
plumbing
and
preferred
not
to
repair
the
facade
,
since
they
wanted
to
remember
the
chequered
history
of
the
building
.
they
also
carried
out
many
political
actions
designed
to
ensure
their
survival
in
the
house
and
this
made
the
building
unattractive
to
investors
.
for
example
,
when
another
auction
of
the
building
was
held
in
2007
,
outside
the
courtroom
there
were
300
supporters
of
køpi
and
also
300
hundred
police
officers
.
beforehand
,
the
police
had
voiced
concerns
about
violence
,
warning
that
the
political
situation
was
already
tense
after
a
solidarity
demonstration
for
ungdomshuset
.
the
auction
was
this
time
successful
,
the
building
being
sold
for
835
,
000
(
half
the
estimated
market
value
)
to
an
agent
of
the
new
owner
called
besnik
fichtner
,
an
albanian
managing
director
of
the
company
plutonium
114
.
he
also
bought
two
neighbouring
properties
for
900
,
000
.
the
actual
new
owner
was
the
company
novum
köpenicker
straße
133
-
138
gmbh
.
other
sources
reported
the
new
owner
as
the
previously
unknown
company
vkb
gmbh
&
co
.
kg
.
the
versicherungskammer
bayern
in
münich
and
the
volkskreditbank
in
linz
were
forced
to
deny
they
had
anything
to
do
with
the
company
,
despite
having
the
same
initials
as
it
.
køpi
was
immediately
threatened
with
eviction
.
after
one
week
,
the
køpi
residents
had
uncovered
a
paper
trail
leading
to
berlin
-
based
real
estate
developer
siegfried
nehls
.
they
visited
nehls
'
parents
unannounced
and
his
father
invited
them
to
drink
tea
before
nehls
'
brother
called
the
police
.
after
one
month
,
the
police
raided
nehls
'
headquarters
(
named
as
vitalis
beteiligungsgesellschaft
für
altbauten
mbh
)
and
twenty
other
properties
,
investigating
financial
irregularities
.
by
2008
,
fichtner
had
fallen
out
with
nehls
and
signed
a
30
year
rental
contract
with
the
inhabitants
of
køpi
.
there
had
been
no
actual
signed
agreement
between
plutonium
114
and
nehls
,
so
fichtner
was
entitled
to
make
a
contract
.
however
,
fichtner
then
fell
into
debt
and
commerzbank
again
called
for
a
forced
auction
of
køpi
in
2013
.
there
were
also
several
auctions
related
to
the
"
wagenplatz
"
,
which
was
not
covered
by
the
new
rental
agreement
.
there
were
50
people
living
in
the
house
in
2016
and
50
in
the
"
wagenplatz
"
,
a
yard
next
to
the
house
where
people
lived
in
vehicles
and
wagons
.
in
addition
to
being
a
housing
project
,
the
building
hosted
a
variety
of
activities
,
including
a
bar
,
vegan
café
,
concert
venue
,
cinema
,
infoshop
,
gym
,
printing
workshop
,
rehearsal
space
and
a
climbing
wall
.
the
project
is
run
by
a
weekly
plenary
which
takes
place
on
sundays
.
only
inhabitants
of
köpi
and
members
of
projects
using
the
space
are
allowed
to
attend
.
no
mobile
phones
are
permitted
.
a
report
by
the
senate
department
of
internal
affairs
and
the
police
in
2017
stated
that
"
in
general
,
it
can
be
determined
that
the
object
köpi
137
serves
both
as
a
retreat
for
left
-
motivated
criminals
and
as
a
starting
point
for
crimes
.
"
in
response
,
a
køpi
spokesperson
stated
that
"
the
presence
of
police
on
our
site
is
often
met
with
hostility
,
the
parking
of
tourist
buses
and
structural
changes
in
the
area
are
perceived
as
an
expression
of
gentrification
processes
.
displeasure
about
these
things
occasionally
results
in
criminally
relevant
actions
.

a
funeral
and
a
floral
arrangement
signed
"
louise
"
.
the
man
'
s
true
identity
remained
unknown
for
a
year
and
a
half
until
ruby
ogletree
,
an
alabama
woman
who
had
seen
a
photo
of
a
distinctive
scar
on
his
head
in
the
news
,
identified
him
as
her
son
artemus
.
she
said
he
had
left
birmingham
in
1934
at
the
age
of
17
to
hitchhike
to
california
.
later
she
received
two
letters
purportedly
from
him
,
some
from
as
far
away
as
egypt
.
in
august
1935
a
caller
claiming
to
be
from
memphis
,
tennessee
,
told
her
that
artemus
was
in
cairo
.
the
letters
had
also
been
sent
after
artemus
'
s
death
.
records
kept
by
shipping
companies
found
no
records
that
ogletree
had
gone
to
egypt
.
no
other
suspect
has
ever
been
identified
.
the
letters
later
were
used
to
link
the
killing
to
a
1937
murder
in
new
york
,
but
no
charges
were
filed
against
the
man
arrested
in
that
case
,
one
of
whose
aliases
had
been
"
donald
kelso
"
.
the
fbi
later
investigated
but
was
unable
to
produce
any
new
leads
.
in
2012
,
a
historian
at
the
kansas
city
public
library
wrote
two
posts
on
the
library
'
s
blog
about
the
case
.
at
the
end
of
the
last
one
he
revealed
that
in
2003
or
2004
,
he
had
taken
a
call
from
someone
out
of
state
related
to
the
case
.
the
caller
said
that
they
had
been
helping
to
inventory
the
belongings
of
a
recently
deceased
elderly
person
when
they
found
a
box
with
newspaper
clippings
about
the
ogletree
case
and
an
item
mentioned
repeatedly
in
the
stories
,
but
they
refused
to
say
what
that
item
was
.
the
kansas
city
police
continue
to
investigate
.
artemus
ogletree
was
born
in
florida
in
1915
,
one
of
three
children
.
during
his
childhood
an
accident
with
some
hot
grease
left
a
sizable
scar
on
his
head
above
his
ear
,
which
remained
hairless
afterward
.
in
1934
he
left
his
family
,
by
then
living
in
birmingham
,
alabama
,
to
hitchhike
to
california
.
he
kept
them
updated
on
his
progress
by
mail
;
they
wired
him
money
.
early
on
the
afternoon
of
january
2
,
1935
,
ogletree
walked
into
the
hotel
president
,
in
the
power
&
light
district
of
kansas
city
,
missouri
,
and
asked
for
an
interior
room
several
floors
up
,
giving
his
name
as
roland
t
.
owen
,
with
a
los
angeles
address
.
staff
remembered
him
as
dressed
well
and
wearing
a
dark
overcoat
;
he
brought
no
bags
with
him
.
ogletree
paid
for
one
night
.
the
staff
noted
that
in
addition
to
the
visible
scar
on
his
temple
,
he
had
cauliflower
ear
,
and
concluded
he
was
probably
a
boxer
or
professional
wrestler
.
they
believed
him
to
be
in
his
early
20s
.
randolph
propst
,
a
bellhop
,
accompanied
ogletree
up
in
the
elevator
to
the
10th
floor
.
on
the
way
,
ogletree
told
him
that
he
had
spent
the
previous
night
at
the
nearby
muehlebach
hotel
but
found
the
$
5
(
$
in
current
dollars
)
nightly
rate
too
high
.
propst
opened
room
1046
,
which
per
the
guest
'
s
request
was
on
the
inside
,
overlooking
the
hotel
'
s
courtyard
rather
than
the
street
outside
.
he
watched
as
ogletree
took
a
hairbrush
,
comb
and
toothpaste
from
his
overcoat
pocket
,
the
extent
of
his
unpacking
.
after
ogletree
put
those
items
above
the
sink
,
he
and
propst
left
the
room
.
the
bellboy
returned
to
lock
it
,
and
gave
ogletree
the
key
.
after
returning
to
the
lobby
,
he
saw
ogletree
leave
the
hotel
.
a
short
time
afterward
,
mary
soptic
,
one
of
the
hotel
maids
,
returned
from
a
day
off
to
work
the
afternoon
shift
.
she
went
into
room
1046
and
was
surprised
to
find
ogletree
there
,
since
the
previous
night
a
woman
had
been
in
the
room
.
she
apologized
,
but
he
said
she
could
go
ahead
and
clean
the
room
.
while
she
did
,
she
noticed
that
he
had
the
shades
drawn
and
left
only
one
dim
lamp
on
.
this
would
remain
the
case
when
she
encountered
ogletree
in
the
room
on
other
occasions
during
his
stay
.
"
he
was
either
worried
about
something
or
afraid
"
in
addition
to
this
preference
for
low
light
,
she
told
police
later
.
after
she
had
been
cleaning
for
a
few
minutes
,
ogletree
put
his
overcoat
on
and
brushed
his
hair
.
he
then
left
,
but
asked
her
to
leave
the
room
unlocked
as
he
was
expecting
some
friends
in
a
few
minutes
.
soptic
did
as
he
asked
.
at
4
p
.
m
.
,
she
returned
to
the
room
with
freshly
laundered
towels
.
inside
,
the
room
was
dark
.
she
saw
ogletree
lying
on
the
bed
,
fully
dressed
.
visible
in
the
light
from
the
hallway
was
a
note
on
his
bedside
table
that
read
"
don
:
i
will
be
back
in
fifteen
minutes
.
wait
"
.
the
next
morning
,
soptic
returned
to
room
1046
around
10
:
30
.
the
door
was
locked
,
which
led
her
to
assume
that
ogletree
was
out
since
it
could
only
be
locked
from
the
outside
,
but
when
she
opened
it
with
her
own
key
ogletree
was
present
,
sitting
in
the
dark
just
where
he
had
been
the
previous
afternoon
.
the
phone
rang
and
he
answered
it
.
"
no
,
don
,
i
don
'
t
want
to
eat
.
i
am
not
hungry
.
i
just
had
breakfast
.
.
.
no
,
i
am
not
hungry
"
,
he
said
.
still
holding
the
phone
,
ogletree
asked
soptic
about
her
job
as
she
cleaned
.
he
wanted
to
know
if
she
was
responsible
for
the
entire
floor
,
and
if
the
president
was
residential
.
he
repeated
his
complaint
about
the
muehlebach
'
s
exorbitant
rates
,
after
which
she
finished
cleaning
,
and
left
.
again
at
4
p
.
m
.
,
soptic
returned
with
fresh
towels
.
inside
room
1046
,
she
could
hear
two
men
talking
,
so
she
knocked
.
a
voice
she
described
as
loud
and
deep
,
probably
not
ogletree
'
s
,
asked
who
it
was
.
she
responded
that
she
had
brought
fresh
towels
,
to
which
the
voice
said
"
we
don
'
t
need
any
"
.
yet
soptic
knew
there
were
no
towels
in
the
room
,
as
she
had
taken
them
herself
in
the
morning
.
two
hours
later
,
jean
owen
of
lee
'
s
summit
,
near
kansas
city
,
checked
into
the
president
after
having
shopped
in
the
city
for
a
few
hours
.
feeling
sick
,
she
had
decided
not
to
drive
back
home
that
night
.
she
was
given
room
1048
;
her
boyfriend
,
who
worked
in
a
flower
shop
in
the
city
,
came
to
visit
her
there
at
9
:
20
p
.
m
.
and
stayed
for
two
hours
.
later
that
night
,
she
told
police
,
she
heard
men
and
women
talking
loudly
and
profanely
all
over
the
floor
.
owen
was
not
the
only
person
to
note
unusual
late
night
activity
on
the
president
'
s
10th
floor
.
elevator
operator
charles
blocher
,
who
began
his
shift
at
midnight
,
reported
later
that
he
was
fairly
busy
until
1
:
30
a
.
m
.
after
that
time
,
most
of
the
hotel
quieted
down
for
the
night
,
except
for
a
loud
party
in
room
1055
.
blocher
recalled
one
visitor
in
particular
,
a
woman
he
had
seen
at
the
hotel
visiting
male
guests
in
their
rooms
on
other
occasions
and
thus
believed
to
be
a
prostitute
,
a
conclusion
shared
by
other
hotel
staff
who
were
familiar
with
her
.
she
came
in
first
sometime
during
his
first
three
hours
;
he
took
her
to
the
10th
floor
where
she
asked
about
room
1026
.
five
minutes
later
,
the
elevator
was
summoned
there
again
;
it
turned
out
to
be
the
same
woman
,
who
expressed
puzzlement
that
her
client
was
not
in
room
1046
since
,
she
said
,
he
had
called
her
and
on
previous
visits
with
him
he
had
always
been
present
.
she
wondered
if
,
in
fact
,
he
was
in
room
1024
since
she
could
see
through
the
room
'
s
transom
window
that
the
light
was
on
in
there
.
she
remained
on
the
floor
after
the
conversation
.
a
half
-
hour
later
,
blocher
got
another
signal
to
take
the
elevator
back
to
the
10th
floor
.
the
woman
was
waiting
again
and
he
took
her
down
to
the
lobby
.
an
hour
later
he
took
her
,
and
a
different
man
,
to
the
9th
floor
.
at
4
:
15
a
.
m
.
,
a
call
from
that
floor
turned
out
to
be
the
woman
;
he
took
her
to
the
lobby
and
she
left
the
hotel
for
the
night
.
another
call
to
the
9th
floor
15
minutes
later
turned
out
to
be
the
man
who
had
come
up
with
her
.
he
told
blocher
he
could
not
sleep
and
was
going
out
for
a
walk
.
whether
these
activities
are
related
to
the
ogletree
case
has
not
been
established
.
he
may
not
have
been
at
the
hotel
earlier
that
night
.
at
11
p

m

robert
lane
,
a
city
worker
driving
on
13th
street
near
lydia
avenue
,
saw
a
man
dressed
in
only
an
undershirt
,
pants
and
shoes
run
into
his
path
and
flag
him
down
.
when
lane
stopped
,
the
man
apologized
,
saying
he
had
taken
lane
'
s
car
for
a
taxi
.
the
man
asked
lane
if
he
could
take
him
to
somewhere
he
might
be
able
to
get
a
taxi
.
lane
agreed
and
let
the
man
in
.
"
you
look
as
if
you
'
ve
been
in
it
bad
"
,
he
observed
;
the
man
swore
he
would
kill
someone
else
tomorrow
,
presumably
in
retaliation
for
whatever
had
been
done
to
him
.
in
the
mirror
lane
saw
a
deep
scratch
on
the
man
'
s
arm
;
he
also
noticed
that
he
was
cupping
his
arm
,
possibly
to
catch
blood
from
a
more
severe
wound
.
at
the
nearby
intersection
of
12th
street
and
troost
avenue
,
where
taxi
drivers
often
waited
for
fares
during
the
overnight
hours
,
lane
stopped
and
let
the
man
out
.
the
man
thanked
him
,
got
out
,
and
honked
the
horn
of
a
taxi
parked
nearby
,
drawing
the
driver
from
a
nearby
restaurant
,
after
which
lane
drove
away
.
after
ogletree
'
s
death
,
lane
went
to
view
the
body
.
he
saw
the
same
scratch
on
the
arm
and
went
to
the
police
,
telling
them
he
believed
ogletree
had
been
the
man
he
picked
up
.
at
7
a
.
m
.
,
a
new
switchboard
operator
,
della
ferguson
,
came
on
shift
.
she
was
preparing
to
make
a
requested
wakeup
call
to
room
1046
when
she
noticed
a
light
indicating
that
the
phone
there
was
off
the
hook
.
propst
,
who
had
led
ogletree
there
two
days
earlier
,
was
on
shift
again
and
drew
the
assignment
.
the
door
to
room
1046
was
locked
,
with
a
"
do
not
disturb
"
sign
hanging
from
the
doorknob
.
after
several
loud
knocks
,
a
voice
from
inside
told
him
to
enter
;
however
he
could
not
as
the
door
had
been
locked
.
the
same
voice
told
him
,
after
another
knock
,
to
turn
on
the
lights
,
but
he
still
could
not
enter
.
finally
,
propst
just
shouted
through
the
door
to
hang
the
phone
up
,
and
left
.
propst
told
ferguson
that
the
guest
in
room
1046
was
probably
drunk
and
she
should
wait
another
hour
.
at
8
:
30
a
.
m
.
,
the
phone
had
still
not
been
hung
up
.
another
bellboy
,
harold
pike
,
was
sent
to
the
10th
floor
.
the
"
do
not
disturb
"
sign
was
still
on
the
door
,
and
it
was
still
locked
,
but
pike
had
a
key
and
let
himself
in
.
inside
he
found
ogletree
in
the
dark
,
lying
on
the
bed
naked
,
apparently
drunk
.
the
light
from
the
hallway
showed
some
dark
spots
on
the
bedding
,
but
rather
than
turn
on
the
room
light
pike
went
to
the
telephone
stand
,
where
he
saw
the
phone
had
been
knocked
to
the
floor
.
he
put
it
back
on
the
stand
,
replacing
the
handset
.
shortly
after
10
:
30
a
.
m
.
,
another
operator
reported
that
the
phone
in
room
1046
was
once
again
off
the
hook
.
again
propst
was
sent
to
the
room
to
see
what
was
going
on
;
the
"
do
not
disturb
"
sign
remained
on
the
knob
.
this
time
he
had
a
key
,
and
after
his
knocks
drew
no
response
,
he
opened
the
door
and
found
ogletree
on
his
knees
and
elbows
two
feet
(
60
cm
)
away
,
his
head
bloodied
.
propst
turned
the
light
on
,
put
the
phone
back
on
the
hook
,
and
then
noticed
blood
on
the
walls
of
both
the
main
room
and
bathroom
,
as
well
as
on
the
bed
itself
.
propst
went
downstairs
immediately
for
help
.
he
returned
with
the
assistant
manager
,
but
when
they
did
they
could
only
open
the
door
six
inches
(
15
cm
)
,
as
ogletree
had
in
the
interim
fallen
on
the
floor
.
eventually
ogletree
got
up
and
when
the
two
hotel
employees
were
able
to
enter
the
room
,
he
went
and
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bathtub
.
the
assistant
manager
called
the
police
;
they
were
joined
by
dr
.
harold
flanders
of
kansas
city
general
hospital
.
ogletree
had
been
bound
with
cord
around
his
neck
,
wrists
,
and
ankles
.
his
neck
had
further
bruising
,
suggesting
someone
had
been
attempting
to
strangle
him
.
he
had
been
stabbed
more
than
once
in
the
chest
above
the
heart
;
one
of
these
wounds
had
punctured
his
lung
.
blows
to
his
head
had
left
him
with
a
skull
fracture
on
the
right
side
.
in
addition
to
the
blood
propst
had
seen
,
there
was
some
additional
spatter
on
the
ceiling
.
dr
.
flanders
cut
the
cords
from
ogletree
'
s
wrist
and
asked
him
who
had
done
this
to
him
.
"
nobody
"
,
ogletree
answered
.
asked
,
then
,
what
had
caused
these
injuries
,
he
said
he
had
fallen
and
hit
his
head
on
the
bathtub
.
the
doctor
asked
if
he
had
been
trying
to
kill
himself
.
after
saying
no
,
ogletree
lost
consciousness
and
was
taken
to
the
hospital
.
he
was
completely
comatose
by
the
time
he
arrived
and
died
shortly
after
midnight
on
january
5
.
the
kansas
city
police
department
(
kcpd
)
began
investigating
immediately
by
interviewing
jean
owen
,
whose
identical
last
name
and
proximity
to
the
dead
man
overnight
struck
them
as
interesting
.
they
detained
her
while
she
told
them
what
she
had
heard
the
night
before
.
after
her
boyfriend
came
to
the
police
station
and
corroborated
her
account
,
she
was
released
and
returned
to
lee
'
s
summit
.
doctors
performed
an
autopsy
on
ogletree
and
determined
he
had
died
from
his
wounds
.
dr
.
flanders
had
examined
not
just
the
body
but
the
bloodstains
in
the
room
.
since
much
of
it
had
dried
by
the
time
he
had
arrived
,
he
estimated
the
wounds
had
been
inflicted
between
4
and
5
a
.
m
.
that
day
,
consistent
with
what
pike
had
seen
and
before
propst
'
s
first
visit
.
detectives
searching
room
1046
took
note
as
much
of
what
they
did
"
not
"
find
as
what
they
did
.
consistent
with
what
propst
had
observed
,
there
were
no
clothes
in
the
closets
or
drawers
.
the
only
evidence
of
anything
other
than
what
ogletree
had
been
wearing
was
the
tag
of
a
necktie
,
indicating
it
had
been
made
by
a
new
jersey
company
.
also
missing
from
the
room
were
the
soap
,
shampoo
,
and
towels
provided
by
the
hotel
to
every
room
.
there
were
no
knives
,
which
led
to
the
dismissal
of
suicide
as
a
cause
of
ogletree
'
s
death
since
the
stab
wounds
in
his
chest
could
not
be
accounted
for
;
the
cords
tying
him
up
also
suggested
the
involvement
of
others
.
one
of
the
room
'
s
two
glasses
was
found
in
the
sink
,
missing
a
piece
;
the
other
was
on
the
shelf
.
detectives
found
some
other
items
that
might
have
been
evidence
:
a
hairpin
,
safety
pin
,
unsmoked
cigarette
,
and
a
full
bottle
of
diluted
sulfuric
acid
.
four
fingerprints
,
small
enough
that
detectives
believed
they
had
been
a
woman
'
s
,
were
found
on
the
room
'
s
phone
;
they
could
not
be
matched
to
ogletree
or
to
any
of
the
hotel
employees
who
had
been
known
to
have
entered
the
room
.
the
police
sought
help
through
the
press
.
both
of
the
city
'
s
evening
newspapers
carried
the
story
on
their
front
pages
the
next
day
.
"
there
is
no
doubt
that
someone
else
is
mixed
up
in
this
"
,
detective
johnson
told
reporters
,
confirming
that
the
case
was
considered
a
homicide
.
it
soon
became
apparent
that
"
roland
t
.
owen
"
was
in
all
likelihood
an
alias
.
officers
in
kansas
city
contacted
the
los
angeles
police
department
(
lapd
)
to
notify
next
of
kin
,
but
were
informed
that
they
could
find
no
record
that
anyone
under
that
name
was
living
in
the
california
city
at
the
time
.
the
dead
man
'
s
fingerprints
were
sent
to
what
was
at
the
time
the
justice
department
'
s
bureau
of
investigation
(
later
the
fbi
)
to
find
a
possible
match
in
their
collection
.
a
woman
called
the
hotel
president
that
night
to
ask
what
"
roland
t
.
owen
"
looked
like
.
she
told
the
desk
that
he
lived
in
clinton
,
southeast
of
kansas
city
.
on
january
6
,
the
sunday
newspapers
reported
that
the
man
in
room
1046
had
died
under
an
assumed
name
,
and
tips
began
coming
in
.
members
of
the
public
went
to
the
local
funeral
home
where
he
had
been
laid
out
,
leading
lane
to
tell
police
of
his
encounter
with
the
man
.
after
interviewing
lane
,
johnson
was
not
as
certain
as
lane
was
that
the
man
had
been
ogletree
,
since
none
of
the
hotel
staff
had
reported
seeing
him
leave
or
return
during
the
night
of
january
3
4
.
police
were
able
to
establish
one
sighting
of
ogletree
outside
the
hotel
,
a
report
that
he
had
been
seen
with
two
women
at
several
"
liquor
places
"
on
12th
street
.
wire
services
began
picking
up
the
story
,
and
it
ran
in
newspapers
and
on
radio
around
the
country
,
with
requests
to
send
photographs
to
kansas
city
.
more
leads
on
the
man
'
s
identity
came
in
as
a
result
,
and
the
kcpd
had
to
devote
considerable
time
to
corresponding
with
police
all
over
the
country
via
mail
and
telegram
to
follow
up
on
leads
.
eventually
they
were
able
to
eliminate
many
.
in
kansas
city
,
an
early
lead
proved
false
when
a
bloodied
towel
found
at
the
hotel
turned
out
to
have
been
used
to
clean
up
room
1046
after
the
police
had
left
.
officers
recalled
propst
'
s
account
that
on
his
way
there
after
he
checked
in
,
the
man
had
said
that
he
had
left
the
nearby
muehlebach
hotel
after
one
night
due
to
their
high
rates
,
and
checked
with
that
hotel
'
s
staff
.
no
roland
t
.
owen
had
checked
in
there
,
but
staff
recalled
a
man
of
ogletree
'
s
appearance
checking
in
under
the
name
eugene
k
.
scott
,
also
giving
los
angeles
as
his
address
,
and
requesting
a
room
on
the
interior
of
the
building
.
again
,
after
investigating
,
the
lapd
reported
that
there
was
no
one
by
that
name
in
their
city
.
the
mystery
seemed
solved
when
a
man
identified
the
body
as
his
cousin
,
but
then
when
the
man
'
s
sister
came
to
view
the
body
,
she
confirmed
that
the
cousin
had
in
fact
died
five
years
earlier
;
the
resemblance
between
the
two
had
been
very
strong
.
a
week
into
the
investigation
,
toni
bernardi
,
a
wrestling
promoter
from
little
rock
,
arkansas
,
said
after
viewing
the
body
that
the
man
,
identifying
himself
as
cecil
werner
,
had
approached
him
around
the
beginning
of
december
1934
about
wrestling
some
matches
.
bernardi
had
referred
him
to
another
promoter
in
omaha
,
nebraska
,
but
that
promoter
did
not
recognize
ogletree
.
within
a
few
days
,
two
new
homicides
in
the
city
drew
detectives
'
attention
away
from
the
case
,
even
as
more
were
assigned
to
the
homicide
squad
.
leads
were
still
followed
,
but
less
vigorously
than
they
had
been
in
the
week
after
the
case
,
and
none
of
them
yielded
any
significant
information
.
newspaper
coverage
likewise
dwindled
.
the
case
returned
to
the
newspapers
on
march
3
,
when
the
funeral
home
where
the
body
had
been
kept
announced
it
would
be
burying
the
man
in
the
city
'
s
potter
'
s
field
the
next
day
.
that
day
,
the
funeral
home
received
a
call
from
a
man
who
asked
that
the
funeral
be
delayed
so
they
could
send
the
funeral
home
the
money
for
a
grave
and
service
at
memorial
park
cemetery
in
kansas
city
,
kansas
,
so
,
the
caller
said
,
the
dead
man
would
be
near
his
sister
.
the
funeral
director
warned
the
caller
he
would
have
to
tell
the
police
about
the
call
;
the
caller
said
he
knew
and
that
did
not
bother
him
.
the
caller
was
slightly
more
forthcoming
when
the
funeral
director
asked
why
ogletree
had
been
killed
.
according
to
the
caller
,
ogletree
had
had
an
affair
with
one
woman
while
engaged
to
marry
another
.
the
caller
and
the
two
women
had
apparently
arranged
the
encounter
with
him
at
the
president
in
order
to
exact
revenge
.
"
cheaters
usually
get
what
'
s
coming
to
them
!
"
the
caller
said
,
and
hung
up
.
the
service
was
postponed
per
the
anonymous
caller
'
s
request
.
on
march
23
,
the
funeral
home
received
a
delivery
envelope
,
the
address
carefully
lettered
using
a
ruler
with
$
25
(
$
in
current
dollars
)
wrapped
in
newspaper
;
it
was
enough
to
cover
the
expenses
.
the
sender
was
unknown
.
two
additional
envelopes
with
$
5
each
were
sent
to
a
local
florist
for
an
arrangement
of
13
american
beauty
roses
to
go
with
the
grave
,
after
a
similar
call
was
made
to
them
;
both
phone
calls
turned
out
to
have
been
made
from
pay
phones
.
included
with
this
payment
was
a
card
,
with
disguised
handwriting
,
reading
"
love
forever
louise
"
.
the
funeral
was
held
shortly
afterwards
.
besides
the
officiating
minister
,
the
only
attendees
were
police
detectives
,
some
of
whom
served
as
pallbearers
.
other
detectives
,
posing
as
gravediggers
,
staked
out
the
grave
for
the
next
several
days
,
but
no
one
came
to
visit
.
several
days
after
the
funeral
,
a
woman
called
the
"
kansas
city
journal
-
post
"
s
newsroom
to
inform
them
that
their
earlier
story
that
the
dead
man
from
room
1046
would
be
buried
in
a
pauper
'
s
grave
was
incorrect
,
that
he
had
in
fact
been
given
a
formal
funeral
.
she
said
the
funeral
home
and
flower
shop
could
verify
this
.
asked
to
identify
herself
,
she
said
"
never
mind
,
i
know
what
i
'
m
talking
about
"
,
pressed
for
what
that
was
,
she
responded
,
"
he
got
into
a
jam
"
,
and
ended
the
conversation
.
images
of
the
dead
man
continued
to
be
circulated
nationwide
in
the
hope
of
identifying
him
.
one
of
these
finally
did
,
when
a
friend
of
ruby
ogletree
in
birmingham
,
alabama
,
showed
her
an
issue
of
"
the
american
weekly
"
,
a
sunday
newspaper
supplement
published
by
the
hearst
corporation
,
with
an
article
about
the
case
.
the
unidentified
man
looked
a
great
deal
like
her
son
artemus
,
whom
the
family
had
not
seen
since
he
left
to
hitchhike
to
california
in
1934
,
although
he
had
kept
up
correspondence
with
them
.
ruby
contacted
the
kcpd
,
and
was
able
to
provide
enough
information
about
the
previous
pseudonymous
corpse
,
including
a
description
of
his
head
scar
,
which
she
explained
was
the
result
of
a
childhood
accident
in
which
some
hot
grease
had
spilled
there
.
in
november
,
another
issue
of
the
supplement
carried
a
story
identifying
the
man
as
artemus
ogletree
and
explaining
how
his
identity
had
been
determined
.
while
that
question
had
been
answered
,
ruby
'
s
account
raised
more
questions
.
she
had
received
several
letters
purportedly
from
her
son
"
after
"
he
had
been
killed
.
the
first
,
early
in
1935
,
postmarked
in
chicago
,
aroused
her
suspicions
since
it
was
typewritten
,
and
artemus
as
far
as
she
knew
did
not
know
how
to
type
.
it
was
also
written
in
a
highly
colloquial
style
,
with
much
slang
,
that
was
not
consistent
with
his
previous
letters
.
in
may
1935
,
another
letter
purportedly
from
artemus
said
he
was
going
to
europe
.
it
was
followed
by
a
special
-
delivery
letter
saying
that
his
ship
was
sailing
that
day
.
both
missives
were
sent
from
new
york
.
three
months
later
,
in
august
,
ruby
received
a
telephone
call
from
memphis
,
tennessee
.
a
man
on
the
other
end
of
the
line
told
her
that
artemus
had
saved
his
life
in
a
fight
.
artemus
himself
could
not
call
because
he
was
now
living
in
cairo
,
the
capital
of
egypt
,
where
he
had
married
a
wealthy
woman
and
was
well
.
he
was
unable
to
write
,
the
caller
said
,
because
he
had
lost
one
of
his
thumbs
in
the
fight
where
he
had
saved
the
caller
.
ruby
talked
with
the
man
for
a
half
-
hour
.
she
recalled
that
he
had
talked
wildly
and
irrationally
,
but
seemed
to
have
firsthand
knowledge
of
artemus
.
she
gave
the
police
the
name
the
man
identified
himself
by
;
it
has
never
been
made
public
.
if
artemus
had
,
at
some
point
before
his
death
,
gone
to
egypt
or
anywhere
else
overseas
,
he
had
not
done
so
under
his
own
name
.
no
steamship
company
at
the
time
had
any
record
that
he
had
traveled
with
them
.
the
consular
section
at
the
u
.
s
.
embassy
in
cairo
was
unable
to
find
any
evidence
he
had
been
there
.
information
developed
through
the
police
'
s
conversations
with
ruby
ogletree
helped
them
establish
a
third
hotel
in
kansas
city
,
the
st
.
regis
,
where
artemus
had
stayed
.
there
,
he
had
roomed
with
another
man
.
whether
that
had
been
"
don
"
could
not
be
established
.
in
1937
the
new
york
city
police
arrested
a
man
named
joseph
martin
on
a
murder
charge
,
after
he
had
killed
a
man
he
roomed
with
and
put
the
body
in
a
trunk
to
be
shipped
to
memphis
.
among
the
several
aliases
he
was
found
to
have
used
was
"
donald
kelso
"
.
according
to
a
story
about
the
case
in
"
the
new
yorker
"
,
the
kcpd
had
matched
samples
of
his
handwriting
to
that
in
the
letters
written
to
ruby
ogletree
.
no
charges
were
filed
against
the
man
for
the
ogletree
case
,
and
the
kcpd
kept
the
case
open
.
the
files
show
that
different
detectives
reviewed
the
case
every
few
years
through
the
1950s
.
each
time
they
noted
that
they
would
keep
the
case
open
and
follow
up
,
but
no
new
evidence
was
uncovered
.
gradually
the
case
went
cold
.
in
2003
or
2004
,
john
horner
,
a
local
historian
at
the
kansas
city
public
library
,
fielded
a
call
from
someone
out
of
state
who
said
they
had
been
helping
to
inventory
the
belongings
of
an
elderly
person
who
had
recently
died
.
among
them
was
a
shoebox
which
turned
out
to
be
filled
with
newspaper
clippings
related
to
the
case
,
as
well
as
,
according
to
them
,
one
item
mentioned
in
the
newspaper
stories
.
the
caller
identified
neither
themselves
nor
the
item
.
horner
did
not
make
this
public
until
the
conclusion
of
the
second
of
two
posts
he
made
on
the
library
'
s
blog
retelling
the
story
in
2012
.
the
absence
of
suspects
has
not
prevented
theories
about
the
case
from
arising
.
the
telephone
calls
alleging
that
ogletree
was
killed
in
retaliation
for
his
broken
engagement
have
provided
support
for
that
theory
.
organized
crime
has
also
been
considered
,
since
the
name
"
don
"
can
also
be
a
title
for
a
mafia
boss
.
lastly
,
it
has
been
suggested
that
"
don
"
,
whoever
he
was
,
killed
ogletree
for
some
personal
reason
,
either
with
the
help
of
the
"
commercial
woman
"
blocher
saw
in
the
hotel
late
that
night
or
by
himself
.

gubernatorial
election
giving
the
new

republican
party
total

for

time
since

was

in
the
aftermath
of
his
2016
election
,
then
president
-
elect
donald
trump
claimed
in
a
tweet
that
voter
fraud
had
occurred
in
new
hampshire
.
in
february
2017
,
trump
advisor
stephen
miller
reaffirmed
that
position
by
claiming
"
busing
voters
in
to
new
hampshire
is
widely
known
by
anyone
who
s
worked
in
new
hampshire
politics
"
.
these
claims
were
called
"
baseless
"
by
several
observers
.
in
response
to
those
allegations
,
the
republican
majorities
in
the
new
hampshire
general

drafted
bills
changing

and
was
signed
in
to
law
by
governor
sununu
on
july
,

2017
.
the
new
law
requires
voters
to
declare
a
"
domicile
"
in
new
hampshire
.
it
also
included
jail
sentences
of
up

,

,
if

republicans
pointed
to
over
5
,
000
voters
who
voted
in
the
2016
election
after
identifying
with
an
out

driver
'
s
licence
,
that
have
not
gotten
an
in

state
licence
as

september
2017
.
democrats
suspected
a
voter
suppression
scheme
,
that
targeted
college
students
,
that
they
think
are
most
likely
to
use
identification
issued
by
other
states
.
the
league
of
women
voters
,
the
new
hampshire
democratic
party
and
several
college
students
challenged
the
new
law
in
court
.
they
pointed
to
the
supreme
court
'
s
decision
in
symm
v
.
united
states
,
that
guaranteed
college
students
the
right
to
vote
at
their
university
.
the
trial
judge
of
the
hillsborough
superior
court
decided
on
october
22
,
2018
,
that
the
state
cannot
apply
the
law
in
the
upcoming
elections
.
the
attorney
general
of
new
hampshire
'
s
office
then
filed
an
emergency
motion
with
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
.
the
state
supreme
court
sided
with
the
state
in
an
unanimous
5
-
0
decision
arguing
that
overturning
the
law
so
close
to
elections
was
potentially
confusing
and
disruptive
.
the
state
supreme
court
did
not
decide
on
the
merits
of
the
law
in
this
decision
.
therefore
,

was
first
applied
in
the
2018

george
nathanael
anderson
(
august

,
1883
october
8
,
1958
)
was
an
american
lutheran
pastor
and
missionary
to
tanganyika
.
anderson
studied
at
bethany
college
in
lindsborg
,
kansas
and
the
augustana
theological
seminary
before
being
ordained
by
the
augustana
evangelical
lutheran
church
in
1912
.
he
held
a
succession
of
posts
in
the
american
mid
west
before
volunteering
for
missionary
service
.
anderson
was
sent
to
the
british
colony
of
tanganyika
in
1924
to
review
the
situation
there
.
as
a
former
german
colony
the
territory
had
hosted
missions
of
the
german
lutheran
church
but
these
were
expelled
in
1917
during
the
first
world
war
.
anderson
reported
favourably
and
a
formal
augustana
church
mission
was
sent
in
1926
,
with
anderson
at
its
head
.
anderson
oversaw
the
expansion
of
the
church
'
s
role
in
the
territory
and
in
1944
was
appointed
president
and
director
of
its
general
administrative
committee
,
becoming
responsible
for
the
church
'
s
entire
operation
in
tanganyika
.
he
retired
in
1956
and
died
in
the
united
states
two
years
later
.
george
nathanael
anderson
was
born
on
august
8
,
1883
in
morganville
,
kansas
.
he
graduated
from
bethany
college
in
lindsborg
,
kansas
in
1909
.
he
later
graduated
from
the
augustana
theological
seminary
;
studied
at
the
university
of
minnesota
and
the
union
theological
seminary
and
was
awarded
a
doctorate
.
anderson
was
ordained
as
a
pastor
in
1912
and
found
work
preaching
in
the
midwestern
united
states
with
the
augustana
evangelical
lutheran
church
.
at
one
point
he
was
at
the
first
lutheran
church
in
saint
paul
,
minnesota
where
he
ministered
to
a
congregation
of
over
1
,
500
people
.
in
1919
he
was
amongst
a
group
of
people
praying
at
a
church
meeting
for
a
new
bible
school
to
train
lutheran
missionaries
.
amongst
the
attendees
was
annette
elmquist
,
who
had
attended
a
non
-
lutheran
bible
school
and
was
keen
for
the
church
to
have
its
own
.
soon
afterwards
elmquist
and
anderson
were
married
.
the
lutheran
church
had
been
active
in
missionary
work
in
tanganyika
before
the
first
world
war
,
however
the
largely
german
missionaries
were
expelled
by
british
forces
in
1917
.
the
augustana
church
was
asked
to
take
over
the
abandoned
missions
by
the
german
lutheran
church
and
in
summer
1924
anderson
with
his
wife
and
three
sons
(
leroy
.
paul
and
marcus
)
visited
the
colony
.
anderson
reported
good
potential
in
the
area
and
a
formal
mission
was
dispatched
by
the
church
in
1926
,
with
anderson
being
appointed
a
missionary
by
the
church
'
s
board
of
foreign
missions
.
after
some
deliberation
(
he
would
have
to
leave
behind
his
family
,
including
daughter
dorothy
who
was
then
ill
with
tuberculosis
)
anderson
agreed
and
returned
to
tanganyika
on
january
6
,
1926
with
fellow
missionaries
herbert
s
magney
and
ludwig
melander
.
anderson
initially
spent
his
time
teaching
new
pastors
at
the
mission
'
s
seminary
in
marangu
but
reported
to
the
church
that
there
was
a
good
appetite
for
the
lutheran
faith
in
iramba
and
it
was
decided
to
establish
a
mission
there
.
anderson
was
appointed
head
of
the
mission
and
led
four
american
missionaries
and
one
from
leipzig
(
who
held
russian
citizenship
and
so
was
permitted
entry
by
the
british
authorities
)
.
anderson
'
s
speciality
was
in
evangelism
and
the
study
of
the
iramba
language
,
into
which
he
translated
the
new
testament
and
various
hymns
,
liturgies
and
catechisms
.
anderson
'
s
wife
and
children
joined
him
at
iramba
from
1927
and
remained
with
him
until
his
retirement
in
1956
,
though
annette
would
sometimes
reside
in
the
united
states
with
some
of
the
children
to
ensure
their
education
.
one
son
,
marcus
,
died
in
iramba
of
malaria
.
they
had
seven
surviving
children
of
which
four
sons
became
pastors
,
including
one
who
was
a
missionary
in
tanganyika
.
one
of
anderson
'
s
daughters
married
a
missionary
and
served
for
her
entire
life
at
a
mission
in
iramba
.
anderson
occasionally
returned
to
the
united
states
on
leave
and
during
these
periods
worked
to
generate
support
for
the
african
missions
.
during
one
such
visit
he
helped
to
found
the
lutheran
bible
institute
.
from
1944
he
was
appointed
president
and
director
of
the
general
administrative
committee
of
the
augustana
lutheran
church
(
which
until
1944
was
known
as
the
general
committee
of
former
german
missions
)
.
in
this
role
,
which
he
held
until
1952
,
he
was
responsible
for
liaising
with
the
tanganyikan
government
.
one
key
task
was
to
negotiate
with
the
colony
'
s
government
over
the
ownership
of
land
and
property
formerly
held
by
the
german
lutheran
church
.
during
anderson
'
s
time
in
africa
the
lutheran
missions
expanded
to
encompass
a
number
of
churches
and
dispensaries
,
a
hospital
at
kiomboi
and
leper
centres
at
mkalama
and
iambi
.
he
described
the
effect
of
listening
to
a
congregation
of
2
,
000
singing
luther
'
s
hymn
"
a
mighty
fortress
is
our
god
"
:
"
i
never
heard
it
sung
with
more
spirit
;
the
effect
was
almost
overwhelming
"
.
anderson
retired
in
1956
and
was
invited
to
remain
in
tanganyika
by
the
local
church
but
chose
to
return
to
the
united
states
.
he
died
on
october

(
dave
)
roberts
(
brenock
o
'
connor
)
,
is
living
in
his
parents
'
house
in
sevenoaks
.
he
wishes
to
follow
a
major
football
(
soccer
)
team
,
but
because
of
his
father
'
s
strong
disapproval
,
he
is
forced
into
secretly
following
his
local
club
,
bromley
fc
,
who
at
that
time
were
losing
almost
every
game
they
played
.
nonetheless
,
david
instantly
becomes
a
devoted
fan
.
he
attends
,
and
carefully
analyses
every
match
,
and
keeps
a
scrapbook
of
every
press
mention
they
get
,
no
matter
how
negative
.
his
favorite
player
is
the
team
'
s
star
,
center
forward
alan
"
stoney
"
stonefield
(
ross
anderson
)
.
david
meets
and
become
close
friends
with
three
adult
bromley
fc
fans
(
tj
herbert
,
mark
dymond
,
ewen
macintosh
)
who
encourage
and
support
him
.
dave
also
meets
,
and
rapidly
falls
in
love
with
,
ruby
mcqueen
(
savannah
baker
)
,
the
pretty
and
bright
teenage
daughter
of
charlie
mcqueen
(
jamie
foreman
)
,
the
tough
scary
chairman
of
the
football
club
.
having
sneaked
into
charlie
mcqueen
'
s
office
,
and
noticed
some
notes
on
player
'
s
files
,
dave
believes
that
mcqueen
has
received
large
cash
offers
from
both
manchester
united
and
leeds
united
to
sell
stoney
away
from
bromley
.
it
seems
to
dave
that
mcqueen
is
planning
to
accept
,
in
order
to
pay
off
his
massive
gambling
debts
,
which
have
rendered
the
club
bankrupt
.
dave
happens
to
accidentally
meet
stoney
,
who
turns
out
to
be
very
kind
,
and
strikes
up
a
friendship
with
him
.
the
news
of
the
supposed
offer
to
buy
stoney
is
leaked
to
the
press
.
the
chairman
see
this
news
on
television
,
and
now
imagines
he
will
be
able
to
pay
off
all
his
gambling
debts
and
come
out
ahead
.
he
announces
the
good
news
about
stoney
at
a
party
,
and
explains
he
can
now
afford
to
send
his
daughter
to
university
to
become
a
doctor
,
her
dream
.
but
dave
suddenly
understands
that
he
misinterpreted
what
he
read
:
the
notes
he
saw
were
not
about
cash
offers
from
leading
football
clubs
,
instead
they
were
offers
to
ruby
from
manchester
university
and
leeds
university
.
there
will
be
no
money
coming
in
.
in
order
to
save
bromley
,
dave
browbeats
the
chairman
into
selling
his
expensive
sports
car
,
and
betting
all
of
the
cash
on
bromley
fc
to
win
their
final
game
of
the
season
,
at
odds
of
10
to
1
against
.
dave
also
demands
that
the
chairman
allow
him
to
manage
the
team
for
this
one
final
game
.
despite
dave
'
s
attempts
to
suggest
a
new
game
plan
,
the
first
half
of
the
game
goes
poorly
,
with
bromley
scoring
an
own
goal
.
but
then
dave
accidentally
finds
out
that
his
father
was
originally
a
brilliant
athlete
who
played
youth
soccer
for
england
before
being
crippled
in
an
accident
on
the
field
.
before
the
bromley
team
goes
out
for
the
second
half
,
dave
gives
an
impassioned
speech
,
which
stoney
endorses
,
and
which
causes
the
team
to
play
better
than
anyone
would
have
thought
possible
.
first
a
tie
goal
is
scored
,
and
then
stoney
manages
to
score
a
very
challenging
goal
on
a
free
kick
,
and
bromley
fc
wins
2
-
1
.
dave
is
carried
off
the
field
in
triumph
,
and
joy
all
round

against

he
waged

lost

john
goodrich
(
loyalist
)
john
goodrich
(
1722
1785
)
was
a
virginia
-
born
british
planter
,
merchant
shipper
,
and
privateer
.
uncommitted
at
the
beginning
of
the
american
revolution
,
he
was
recruited
by
lord
dunmore
to
become
a
loyalist
privateer
.
by
his
own
estimation
,
he
destroyed
five
hundred
vessels
in
the
service
of
the
british
crown
.
goodrich
was
born
in
virginia
in
1722
,
one
of
several
children
of
john
goodrich
(
d
.
1746
)
.
unlike
many
loyalists
,
goodrich
had
deep
roots
in
colonial
america
;
his
immigrant
ancestor
,
"
john
guttreidge
"
,
had
patented
land
in
virginia
in
1654
.
in
1747
he
married
the
descendant
of
another
prominent
local
family
,
margaret
bridger
,
a
descendant
of
the
17th
-
century
virginia
political
figure
general
joseph
bridger
.
they
raised
a
large
family
,
including
a
number
of
sons
that
would
follow
their
father
into
mercantile
pursuits
and
,
later
,
privateering
.
one
of
his
daughters
,
agatha
,
married
robert
shedden
,
who
would
also
become
a
prominent
loyalist
as
well
as
goodrich
'
s
business
partner
.
some
of
his
close
relatives
ended
up
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
conflict
,
including
two
nephews
who
served
as
officers
on
the
patriot
side
.
a
keen
businessman
,
goodrich
spent
his
early
adult
years
expanding
his
landholdings
.
over
the
course
of
several
years
,
he
purchased
hundreds
of
acres
of
land
in
nansemond
and
isle
of
wight
counties
.
by
1771
he
owned
over
2
,
000
acres
of
land
,
some
of
it
described
as
the
best
land
in
the
county
.
starting
in
the
1760s
,
he
began
to
turn
his
interest
from
farming
to
shipping
.
he
and
his
sons
owned
and
operated
a
dozen
ships
by
1774
,
and
goodrich
also
owned
his
own
wharves
,
dry
goods
stores
,
warehouses
,
and
other
establishments
useful
to
his
shipping
business
.
operating
primarily
out
of
portsmouth
,
his
small
fleet
shipped
agricultural
and
timber
commodities
to
the
west
indies
and
to
other
ports
in
the
colonies
.
the
revolutionary
war
posed
a
serious
threat
to
merchants
like
goodrich
,
with
blockades
cutting
off
imports
and
exports
,
and
privateers
from
both
sides
attacking
merchant
vessels
.
goodrich
himself
does
not
seem
to
have
been
particularly
ideological
;
both
sides
of
the
conflict
apparently
understood
he
was
more
motivated
by
profit
than
politics
.
regardless
,
the
patriot
side
decided
to
enlist
the
aid
of
the
goodrich
family
.
using
one
of
goodrich
'
s
sons
,
william
,
as
a
go
-
between
,
they
provided
5
,
000
for
the
purchase
of
powder
in
the
west
indies
,
with
the
understanding
that
john
goodrich
,
the
father
,
would
assist
him
in
successfully
bringing
the
cargo
back
without
attracting
notice
.
the
family
elected
to
also
purchase
other
cargo
on
the
trip
,
risking
the
wrath
of
both
the
british
and
patriot
sides
.
this
mission
proved
to
be
a
debacle
for
the
goodriches
.
though
the
powder
did
reach
its
destination
,
an
intercepted
letter
to
john
goodrich
from
his
son
-
in
-
law
robert
shedden
revealed
the
conspiracy
to
dunmore
,
who
took
shedden
and
another
of
goodrich
'
s
sons
into
custody
.
with
john
goodrich
,
jr
.
,
held
as
hostage
,
the
elder
john
goodrich
sought
an
audience
with
dunmore
,
where
he
expressed
"
sincere
repentance
of
what
was
past
and
his
earnest
desire
of
returning
to
his
duty
"
.
though
he
recognized
goodrich
'
s
essentially
mercenary
character
,
dunmore
seized
the
opportunity
to
augment
british
forces
with
a
family
of
experienced
,
capable
,
and
ambitious
ship
captains
.
having
been
convinced
that
his
family
'
s
interests
would
be
better
served
by
the
british
,
goodrich
and
his
family
turned
to
the
loyalist
cause
.
the
start
of
goodrich
'
s
career
as
a
loyalist
was
not
auspicious
.
he
set
out
to
the
west
indies
to
reclaim
some
of
the
money
that
had
been
left
with
a
merchant
there
to
purchase
additional
powder
,
but
was
quickly
captured
by
british
forces
unaware
of
his
new
loyalties
and
promptly
sent
back
to
dunmore
.
the
patriots
were
,
likewise
,
initially
confused
regarding
his
loyalties
.
he
was
actually
imprisoned
by
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
,
which
suspected
him
"
of
being
unfriendly
to
the
colony
"
,
but
when
witnesses
failed
to
appear
he
was
released
on
a
bond
of
1
,
000
and
the
condition
that
he
not
be
of
assistance
to
america
'
s
enemies
.
goodrich
and
two
of
his
sons
were
almost
immediately
charged
again
,
this
time
with
violating
the
articles
of
association
.
on
9
march
1776
,
the
virginia
committee
of
safety
sequestered
the
lands
and
property
of
the
goodrich
family
,
and
when
one
of
the
goodrich
sons
was
caught
attempting
to
transport
slaves
and
stock
from
the
sequestered
property
,
the
committee
had
the
property
confiscated
and
put
up
for
auction
.
this
marked
a
decisive
break
with
the
patriot
side
;
general
charles
lee
ordered
goodrich
'
s
house
,
as
well
as
two
of
his
ships
,
burned
,
justifying
it
on
the
grounds
that
goodrich
was
one
"
of
the
most
notorious
traitors
"
,
and
that
it
would
be
a
warning
to
others
not
to
work
with
dunmore
.
under
his
agreement
with
dunmore
,
goodrich
'
s
ships
had
been
commissioned
directly
into
government
service
,
and
he
and
his
sons
became
some
of
the
most
notorious
of
the
loyalist
privateers
.
he
was
captured
in
north
carolina
on
17
april
1776
while
engaged
in
privateering
,
and
by
may
was
in
a
virginia
jail
.
being
found
guilty
of
treason
,
his
entire
estate
was
confiscated
and
he
was
imprisoned
under
guard
,
effectively
a
prisoner
of
war
.
his
sons
vehemently
rejected
the
committee
'
s
offer
of
neutrality
and
continued
in
royal
service
,
with
one
joining
simcoe
'
s
rangers
,
and
john
goodrich
himself
returned
to
privateering
after
escaping
prison
.
later
in
the
war
,
goodrich
'
s
privateering
operation
moved
to
new
york
,
and
grew
over
the
course
of
the
war
to
four
fighting
vessels
;
the
largest
,
"
the
dunmore
"
,
was
a
sixteen
-
gun
ship
.
after
the
war
,
goodrich
and
several
of
his
family
members
left
the
united
states
and
settled
in
england
.
he
died
in
november
of
1785
,
aged
63
years
,
and
was
interred
at
topsham
church
in
devon
.
edmund
randolph
,
in
his
"
history
of
virginia
"
,
remarked
regarding
goodrich
and
his
sons
that
"
virginia
never
repaired
the
loss
which
she
sustained
in
these
men
.
"
in
england
,
the
descendants
of
john
goodrich
were
known
as
the
goodriches
of
energlyn
.
his
son
john
goodrich
,
jr
.
was
high
sheriff
of
glamorganshire
in
1798
,
while
another
descendant
,
james

,

international
criminal
court
investigation
in
palestine
on
20
december
2019
,
international
criminal
court
chief
prosecutor
fatou
bensouda
announced
an
investigation
into
alleged
war
crimes
committed
during
the
israeli
-
palestinian
conflict
.
a
preliminary
investigation
had
been
ongoing
since
2015
.
israel
is
not
a
member
of
icc
,
but
the
state
of
palestine
was
allowed
to
join
in
2015
.
israel
has
argued
that
the
court
does
not
apply
to
the
israeli
-
palestinian
conflict
because
palestine
is
not
a
state
,
as
israeli
attorney
general
avichai
mandelblit
argued
in
a
brief
released
hours
before
bensouda
'
s
announcement
.
on
three
previous
occasions
,
bensouda
has
refused
to
open
investigations
against
israel
related
to
the
2010
gaza
flotilla
raid
.
according
to
bensouda
,
the
criteria
for
a
full
investigation
had
all
been
met
,
but
jurisdiction
had
not
been
established
.
bensouda
stated
,
"
i
am
satisfied
that
war
crimes
have
been
or
are
being
committed
in
the
west
bank
,
including
east
jerusalem
,
and
the
gaza
strip
"
.
according
to
bensouda
'
s
report
,
the
israeli
judicial
system
already
makes
provision
for
punishing
those
accused
of
war
crimes
meaning
that
the
icc
may
not
have
jurisdiction
over
alleged
israeli
violations
.
bensouda
also
found
"
a
reasonable
basis
to
believe
that
members
of
hamas
and
palestinian
armed
groups
"
are
guilty
of
war
crimes
,
but
these
groups
have
no
mechanism
for
punishing
such
violations
.
israel
is
accused
of
illegally
establishing
west
bank
settlements
and
violating
the
laws
of
war
during
the
2014
gaza
war
,
including
claims
of
targeting
red
cross
installations
.
armed
palestinian
organizations
,
including
hamas
,
are
accused
of
deliberately
attacking
israeli
civilians
and
using
palestinians
as
human
shields
.
israeli
prime
minister
benjamin
netanyahu
condemned
the
investigation
as
"
a
black
day
for
truth
and
justice
"
and
"
pure
antisemitism
"

after
finishing
high
school
he
was
accepted
to
the
academic
reserve
(
in

)
and
studied
physics

mathematics
at
the
hebrew
university
,
in
a
special

which
included
computer
studies
for
the
first
time
in

was
asked
to
continue
his
reserve
service
in
the
idf
,
as
an
exception
,
until
the
age
of
56
,
since
he
had
developed
the
modeling
scientific
basis
for
the
modern
forecasting
infrastructure
at
the
meteorological
service
and
the
air
force
.
alpert
is
married
to
rachel

is
the
father
of
eight
children

during
his
service
as
a
meteorology
officer
in
the
israel
air
force
,
alpert
was
confronted
with
the
severe
difficulty
of
flood
forecasting
.
this
motivated
him
to
develop
new
techniques
to
predict
and
monitor
rain
,
as
well
as
to
develop
high
-
resolution
models
to
improve
forecasting
.
in
parallel
with
his
military
service
,
he
began
to
work
at
the
hebrew
university
on
light
scattering
from
atmospheric
aerosols
.
after
his
release
from
the
idf
he
began
his
ph
.
d
.
studies
at
the
hebrew
university
of
jerusalem
,
during
which
he
built
his
own
meteorological
model
,
which
successfully
explained
the
typical
summer
afternoon
storms
over
the
sea
of
galilee
(
lake
kinneret
)
.
upon
finishing
his
ph
.
d
.
in
1980
,
he
was
invited
to
a
post

doctorate
at
harvard
university
.
for
two
years
alpert
worked
with
richard
lindzenand
studied
the
indian
monsoon
.
during
his
post
-
doctorate
he
developed
a
physical
model
incorporating
feedback
from
the
moist
surface
.
after
two
years
in
boston
,
in
1982
,
he
was
invited
by
the
department
of
geophysics
and
planetary
sciences
at
tel
-
aviv
university
(
now
the
department
of
earth
sciences
)
to
become
a
faculty
member
.
in
the
year
2004
he
was
elected
an
honorary
member
of
the
world
jewish
academy
for
sciences

during
the
years
2005
-
2008
alpert
served
as
head
of
the
department

at
tel
-
aviv
university
,
and
then
in
2008
-
2013
he
served
as
the
head
of
the
tau
porter
school
for
environmental
studies
.
alpert
s
research
group
is
engaged
in
theoretical
studies
and
observations
of
the
dynamics
of
atmospheric
processes
,
using
hydro
-
dynamical
models
for
numerically
solving
the
development
of
different
phenomena
.
he
was
the
first
to
investigate
theoretically
several
synoptic
systems
in
israel
,
including
sharav
low
,
cyprus
low
,
red
sea
trough
,
etc
.
remote
sensing
observations
include
satellites
,
radar
,
and
recently
data
collected
by
cellular
antennas
used
for
communication
.
this
last
source
was
first
identified
in
his
research
,
published
in
"
science
"
magazine
.
recently
this
method
was
applied
for
novel
flood
warning
and
monitoring
of
rain
,
fog
,
and
humidity
.
in
order
to
investigate
atmospheric
phenomena
alpert
devised
a
method
allowing
for
the
identification
of
the
effect
by
different
factors
,
including
separation
of
synergistic
effects
.
the
atmospheric
models
applied
by
alpert
are
of
three
different
types
:
the
first
is
used
for
study
of
weather
forecasting
difficulties
,
and
investigating
phenomena
such
as
rain
,
cyclone
genesis
,
winds
,
etc
.
the
second
type
is
of
climate
models
which
can
be
run
~
100
years
into
the
future
,
and
with
this
method
alpert
was
the
first
to
investigate
detailed
potential
climate
changes
due
to
global
warming
in
the
middle
-
east
.
the
third
type
of
models
focuses
on
aerosols
in
the
atmosphere
,
with
emphasis
on
mineral
dust
mainly
from
the
sahara
and
the
middle
-
east
region
,
as
well
as
sea
-
salt
particles
,
and
their
effect
on
weather
and
climate
.
alpert
has
published
over
240
articles
in
scientific
peer
-
reviews
journals
,
and
an
additional
~
100
chapters
in
books
.
in
2011
his
book
"
factor
separation
in
the
atmosphere
:
applications
and
future
prospects
"
was
published
by
cambridge
academic
press
.
the
book
describes
the
factor
separation
method
that
he
developed
since
1993
for
investigating
interactions
in
the
atmosphere
.
the
method
was
adopted
globally
by
many
research
groups
,
and
the
book
describes
many
and
various
applications
.
in
2009
his
book
"

in
this
book
alpert
analyses
weather
phenomena
appearing
in
jewish
literature
,
provides
modern
scientific
explanations
,
and
ties
the
literary
descriptions
to
common
situations
in
the
climate
of
israel

the
book
reproduces
the
historic
journal
written

alpert
s
uncle
during
the
british
mandate
,
when
he
served
as
a

niangniang
shiji
niangniang
(
)
is
a
goddess
in
chinese
religion
and
taoism
.
before
becoming
goddess
,
she
was
a
10
,
000
-
year
-
old
demoness
.
it
was
originally
a
stone
and
was
born
outside
the
heavens
and
the
earth
,
during
the
chaos
era
and
the
xuanhuang
era
.
shiji
was
originally
a
major
villain
from
the
mythical
classic
"
compendium
of
information
on
the
gods
of
the
three
religions
"
(
三教搜神大全
)
,
and
featured
in
the
chinese
novel
"
fengshen
yanyi
"
as
a
major
antagonist
of
nezha
.
shiji
was
originally
a
stone
,
who
receives
the
essence
of
the
sun
and
the
moon
,
that
was
born
beyond
the
cosmos
and
has
become
a
divine
spirit
by
undergoing
earth
,
water
,
fire
and
air
.
after
countless
thousands
of
years
,
it
became
spiritual
.
after
10
,
000
years
of
cultivation
,
this
stubborn
stone
finally
became
a
human
figure
.
shiji
was
later
accepted
by
the
heavenly
master
tongtian
jiaozhu
as
a
student
.
after
attaining
taoism
,
it
took
thousands
of
years
to
practice
.
although
the
speed
of
practice
is
very
slow
,
because
of
countless
years
,
shiji
has
a
profound
understanding
of
tao
.
as
far
as
its
comprehensive
strength
is
concerned
,
it
is
still
above
taiyi
zhenren
.
shiji
is
a
demon
leader
who
is
detrimental
to
the
world
and
opposed
the
heaven
.
she
gave
birth
to
the
monsters
and
demons
because
the
world
were
flooded
,
the
jade
emperor
was
furious
.
jade
emperor
has
ordered
nezha
down
to
earth
incarnate
demon
slayer
.
one
day
,
nezha
used
the
bow
and
arrow
of
rulai
to
shoot
kill
shiji
'
s
children
,
and
finally
shiji
was
also
killed
with
a
magic
pestle
(
魔杵
)
.
shiji
lives
in
the
white
bone
cave
of
skull
mountain
,
and
there
are
two
apprentices
under
the
gate
,
biyun
tongzi
and
caiyun
tonger
.
one
day
,
nezha
shot
an
arrow
and
unexpectedly
killed
the
gatekeeper
biyun
tongzi
.
she
came
to
seek
revenge
nezha
and
his
father
li
jing
to
be
justified
.
nezha
could
not
beat
shiji
and
his
master
taiyi
zhenren
came
to
protect
him
.
taiyi
attacked
shiji
and
burned
her
with
nine
-
dragon
-
fire
-
net
(
九龙神火罩
)
.
while
trapped
in
this
net
,
taiyi
summoned
several
dragons
which
unleashed
a
large
volley
of
fire
into
the
net
;
instantly
killing
shiji
and
turning
her
back
into
her
original
form
as
a
molten
rock
.
after
her
death
,
jiang
ziya
deified
shiji
as
the
yue
youxingjun
(
月游星君
"
star
of
moon
tour
"
)
.
shiji
is
although
on
the
side
of
law
and
order
,
is
depicted
as
rigid
and
lacking
compassion
.
moreover
,
although
divine
,
both
ao
guang
and
,
especially
,
shiji
are
demonic
figures
in
the
fengshen
yanyi
.
nezha
'
s
crimes
against
them
are
accidental
,
and
he
defends
himself
albeit
excessively
from
their
aggressive
attempts
to
punish
him
.
in
line
with
preceding
argument
,
one
might
also
view
these
circumstances
as
contributing
to
the
author
'
s
careful
construction
of
sympathy
pathy
for
nezha
.
shiji
is
also
related
to
the
stone
born
from

of
the
soviet
union
.
the
process
was
followed
by
transition
to
free
market
economy
and
rapid
social
changes
,
like
impoverishment
of
population
,
high
unemployment
,
and
subsequently
sky
-
rocketing
juvenile
delinquency
,
wide
spread
of
street
drugs
and
adolescent
suicides
during
the
mid
-
1990s
.
living
on
the
streets
exposes
the
youngsters
to
a
wide
number
of
risk
factors
,
and
due
to
their
effect
the
great
part
of
the
infants
falls
behind
in
the
schooling
.
the
main
risks
of
street
life
in
ukraine
are
physical
and
sexual
violence
,
drug
abuse
,
malnutrition
,
police
abuse
and
harassment
,
risky
sexual
activity
,
forced
sex
,
unintended
pregnancy
,
and
different
kinds
of
infections
,
like
hiv
,
tuberculosis
,
stds
and
hepatitis
.
the
risks
contribute
to
the
psychological
and
emotional
condition
of
the
street
youngsters
instigating
among
them
traumatism
,
depressions
,
sense
of
isolation
,
and
insufficient
self
-
esteem
.
in
addition
,
their
opportunities
to
make
a
living
are
very
limited
by
beggary
,
collection
of
empty
bottles
and
so
on
.
as
a
result
their
everyday
surviving
can
be
characterized
as
deviation
from
the
ethical
norms
of
the
civil
society
since
the
street
children
tend
to
be
inclined
to
criminal
activities
(
theft
,
robbery
and
property
damage
)
,
vagrancy
,
substance
abuse
and
prostitution
regardless
of
their
gender
.
it
was
reported
that
the
use
of
drugs
among
ukrainian
homeless
minors
acquired
a
special
meaning
of
symbolic
ritual
.
in
order
to
strengthen
their
subgroup
solidarity
they
have
developed
a
ceremony
to
inject
a
so
called
"
baltrushka
"
(
mixture
of
vinegar
,
water
and
flu
medicine
)
up
to
six
times
a
day
.
another
popular
method
of
drug
taking
in
ukraine
is
inhaling
glue
.
the
uncontrolled
use
of
injection
drugs
,
sharing
needles
and
unprotected
sex
make
the
street
children
extremely
vulnerable
to
hiv
.
the
spread
of
hiv
among
the
ukrainian
street
children
attracted
a
lot
of
special
research
interest
due
to
their
way
of
life
.
the
available
data
show
that
the
street
children
and
youth
of
the
major
cities
make
up
about
33
%
of
total
population
at
risk
.
testing
of
hiv
samples
collected
in
different
ukrainian
cities
demonstrates
that
hiv
prevalence
among
street
children
may
be
as
high
as
50
%
.
according
to
the
obtained
data
around
15
.
5
%
of
street
minors
in
ukraine
used
the
injected
drugs
at
least
once
,
9
.
8
%
of
boys
reported
anal
sex
experience
when
only
36
%
of
them
acknowledged
using
condom
during
their
most
recent
sexual
encounter
.
an
access
of
the
street
minors
to
public
health
services
in
ukraine
is
a
serious
problem
too
due
to
cumbersome
bureaucratic
protocol
and
negative
attitude
of
the
medical
personnel
to
the
homeless
people
.
some
providers
of
the
health
services
may
refuse
to
treat
them
or
provide
just
a
limited
treatment
only
in
life
-
threatening
condirion
.
ukrainian
police
for
minors
treats
the
street
children
as
"
potential
criminals
"
.
the
police
attitude
towards
the
youngsters
may
include
sexual
harassment
and
physical
violence
.
according
to
some
reports
around
75
%
of
the
ukrainian
street
children
have
experienced
a
harassment
from
the
police
and
41
%
have
been
harassed
more
than
tree
times
in
the
past
year
.
unfortunately
,
official
data
about
a
total
number
of
street
children
in
ukraine
are
not
available
.
as
a
result
,
there
is
a
huge
range
of
different
evaluations
between
30
,
000
and
300
,
000
.
an
assessment
of
ukrainian
ministry
of
health
indicated
that
there
is
around
115
,
000
of
adolescents
aged
10
18
who
need
a
protection
.
nevertheless
,
there
is
no
doubts
that
their
number
went
up
significantly
during
last
17
years
.
as
of
2003
,
the
ukrainian
government
estimated
their
number
of
50
,
000
using
data
collected
from
street
shelters
.
a
main
factor
,
which
pushes
the
minors
to
the
street
life
is
an
extreme
poverty
of
ukrainian
population
.
the
adults
has
to
work
longer
hours
or
seek
for
employment
in
neighbor
countries
,
while
their
children
are
being
left
unattended
.
other
factors
are
widespread
alcoholism
and
substance
abuse
,
physical
or
sexual
violence
and
ignoring
the
parenting
responsibilities
within
their
families
.
a
survey
of
ukrainian
children
in
the
age
before
15
demonstrated
that
around
66
%
of
them
used
to
live
with
an
alcoholic
or
illegal
drug
user
,
60
%
have
separated
or
divorced
parents
,
54
%
witnessed
violence
of
intimate
partner
,
around
50
%
experienced
violence
against
themselves
,
41
%
lived
with
ex
-
prisoners
of
ukrainian
penitentiary
system
,
38
%
lived
with
someone
who
was
mentally
sick
or
tried
to

mk285
the
mk285
is
an
airburst
grenade
that
can
be
fired
from
certain
40
mm
belt
-
fed
automatic
grenade
launchers
.
the
grenade
was
designed
for
the
mk
47
grenade
launcher
.
the
mk
47
is
a
candidate
for
replacing
the
mark
19
grenade
launcher
,
first
fielded
in
1968
,
and
still
in
widespread
service
,
around
the
world
.
the
mk
47
is
considerably
lighter
than
the
mk
19
,
is
designed
to
fire
all
the
same
suite
of
grenades
as
the
mk
19
,
together
with
more
modern
grenades
the
mk
19
could
not
fire
,
like
the
mk285
grenade
.
the
mk285
contains
a
programmable
fuse
,
designed
by
bofors
,
that
sets
the
distance
at
which
the
grenade
will
explode
,
when
the
weapon
'
s
trigger
is
pulled
.
the
weapon
'
s
computerized
sight
will
have
measured
the
distance
to
the
target
the
gunner
was
aiming
at
,
and
that
distance
will
be
transferred
to
the
grenade
'
s
fuse
.
the
munition
spins
,
on
its
way
to
the
target
,
and
the
fuse
counts
rotations
to
measure
the
distance
travelled
.
this
airburst
capability
means
that
the
grenade
can
damage
or
disable
soft
targets
,
like
trucks
,
with
a
near
miss
.
it
also
means
the
grenade
can
injure
or
kill
soldiers
who
are
behind
walls
or
in
trenches
,
through
indirect
fire
,
who
could
not
be
hurt
by
more
conventional
grenades
that
exploded
when
hitting
those
walls
.
the
manufacturer
characterizes
the
grenade
as
a
weapon
that
can
hit
around
corners
.
as
of
2015
the
mk
19
remained
the
frontline
grenade
launcher
used
by
the
us
military
.
limited
numbers
of
mk
47
weapons
had
been
issued
to
special
forces
units
.
the
grenade
is
manufactured
by
the
norwegian
firm
nammo
raufoss
.
the
explosive
in
the
grenade
is
classed
as
"
insensitive
"
-
ie
.
less
likely
to
sympathetically
explode
due
to
the
nearby
explosion
of
other
munitions
.

iran
denied

according
to
michael
horton
,
an
expert
on
yemeni
affairs
,
the
notion
that
the
houthis
are
an
iranian
proxy
is
"
nonsense
"

the

,
a
confidential
report
presented
to

sanctions
committee
in

claimed
that

had
been
shipping

to
the
houthi
rebels
since
between

said
that

according
to
american
officials
,
iran
discouraged
houthi
rebels
from
taking
over
the
yemeni
capital
in

2014
,
casting
further
doubt
on
claims
that
the

were
fighting

proxy
war
on

of
iran
.
a

for

that

in

iran

supreme

ayatollah
ali
khamenei
,
said
,
"
the
americans
shamelessly
support
the
killing
of

yemeni
population
,

they
accuse
iran
of
interfering
in

of
sending

only
seeks

provide
medical
and

on

,
saudi
arabia
alleged
that
an
iranian
fishing
boat
loaded
with
weapons
,
including
rockets
and
anti

tank
shells
,
was
intercepted
and
seized
in
the

sea
,
southeast
of
the
omani
port
of
salalah
,
by
arab
coalition
forces

in
may
2019
,
houthi
militias
launched
two
attacks
to
two
pumping
stations
managed
by
saudi
aramco
.
anas
alhajji
,
an
oil
expert
,
said
that
such
an
attack
is
planned
to
damage
the
said
pipelines
as
they
replace
the
strait
of
hormuz
'
s
oil
passages
.
in
march
2015
,
president
barack
obama
declared
that
he
had
authorized
us
forces
to
provide
logistical
and
intelligence
support
to
the
saudis
in
their
military
intervention
in
yemen
,
establishing
a
"
joint
planning
cell
"
with
saudi
arabia
.
this
includes
aerial
refueling
permitting
coalition
aircraft
more
loitering
time
over
yemen
,
and
permitting
some
coalition
members
to
home
base
aircraft
rather
than
relocate
them
to
saudi
arabia
.
according
to
press
reporting
,
many
in
us
socom
reportedly
favor
houthis
,
as
they
have
been
effective
at
combating
al
-
qaeda
and
recently
isil
,
"
something
that
hundreds
of
us
drone
strikes
and
large
numbers
of
advisers
to
yemen
'
s
military
had
failed
to
accomplish
"
.
according
to
a
senior
centcom
commander
,
"
the
reason
the
saudis
didn
'
t
inform
us
of
their
plans
is
because
they
knew
we
would
have
told
them
exactly
what
we
think
that
it
was
a
bad
idea
.
"
as
yemen
expert
michael
horton
puts
it
,
the
us
had
been
"
iran
'
s
air
force
in
iraq
"
,
and
"
al
-
qaeda
'
s
air
force
in
yemen
"
.
according
to
an
al
jazeera
report
,
one
reason
for
us
support
may
be
the
diplomatic
logic
of
tamping
down
sa
'
s
opposition
to
the
iranian
nuclear
deal
by
backing
them
.
another
is
the
view
among
some
us
military
commanders
that
countering
iran
took
strategic
priority
over
combating
al
-
qaeda
and
isil
.
on
30
june
an
hrw
report
stated
that

.
us
representative
ted
lieu
has
been
publicly
raising
concerns
over
us
support
for
saudi
-
led
war
in
yemen
.
in
march
2016
,
he
sent
a
letter
to
secretary
of
state
john
kerry
and
secretary
of
defense
ash
carter
.
he
wrote
in
the
letter
that
the
"
apparent
indiscriminate
airstrikes
on
civilian
targets
in
yemen
seem
to
suggest
that
either
the
coalition
is
grossly
negligent
in
its
targeting
or
is
intentionally
targeting
innocent
civilians
"
.
following
american
concern
about
civilian
casualties
in
the
saudi
-
led
war
in
yemen
,
the
us
military
involvement
is
mostly
ineffective
due
to
coalition
'
s
airstrikes
targeting
civilian
and
hospitals
.
in
2015
the
united
states
deployed
the
green
berets
to
assist
the
saudi
arabian
military
with
missile
interception
.
a
march
2016
human
rights
watch
report
states
that
us
participation
in
specific
military
operations
,
such
as
selecting
targets
and
aerial
refueling
during
saudi
air
raids
"
may
make
us
forces
jointly
responsible

of

war
violations

forces
"
.

million
to

stated
that

in

vetoed

.
with
53
votes
instead
of
the
67
needed
,
the
united
states
senate
failed
to
override
the
veto
.
the
legal
arguments
and
policies
of
the
obama
administration
were
cited
as
justification
for
the
veto
.
the
us
deputy
assistant
secretary
of
defense
michael
mulroy
stated
that
us
support
was
limited
to
side
-
by

side
coaching
to
mitigate
civilian
casualties
and
if
the
measure
had
passed
it
would
do
nothing
to
help

people
of

may
only
increase

deaths
.
mulroy
supported
the

peace
talks

he
pushed
the

to
come
together
and
chart
a
comprehensive
way
ahead
for

writing
in

"
,
mohamad
bazzi
argued
that
mulroy
'
s
defence
of
us
support
as
necessary
to
limit
civilian
casualties
was
false
,
and
that
"
saudi

have
ignored

entreaties
to
minimize

casualties
since

the
uk
is
one
of
the
largest

expressed

for

six

,
oxfam
said
the
uk
was
"
quietly
fuelling
the
yemen
conflict
and
exacerbating
one
of

world
'

worst
humanitarian
crises
"
by
keeping
its

pipeline
to

open
;
the

(

)
agreed
that
"

been
central
to
the
devastation
of

.
"
in
mid
-
september
2015
,
the
deputy
chief
executive
of
oxfam
complained
that
the

even
refused
to
reveal
to
parliament
the
details
of
the
37
arms
export
licences
it
had
granted
for
sales
to
saudi
arabia
since
march
that
year
.
the
attack
on
yemen
saw
sales
of
uk
bombs
for
2015
increase
from
9m
to
over
1bn
in
three
months
.
amnesty
international
and
human
rights
watch
have
shown
that
uk
arms
are
being
used
on
civilian
targets
.
furthermore
,
the
uk
government
has
been
repeatedly
accused
of
violating
domestic
,
eu
,
and
international
law
,
in
particular
the
arms
trade
treaty
,
by
maintaining
its
flow
of
weapons
to
the
kingdom
.
despite
this
,
it
was
reported
in
november
2015
that
the
uk
planned
a
number
of
high
-
level
visits
to
saudi
arabia
over
the
following
three
to
six
months
with
the
aim
of
securing
major
arms
deals
.
in
january
2016
,
it
emerged
that
uk
military
advisors
were
assisting
saudi
personnel
in
the
selection
of
targets
.
on
2
february
2016
,
the
international
development
select
committee
finally
added
its
call
for
the
uk
to
cease
exporting
arms
to
saudi
arabia
and
to
end
its
opposition
to
an
independent
international
inquiry
into
the
way
the
military
campaign
had
been
conducted
thus
far
.
the
committee
'
s
call
went
unheeded
;
indeed
,
just
weeks
later
,
on
the
day
the
eu
held
a
non
-
binding
vote
in
favour
of
an
arms
embargo
on
the
country
because
of
its
destructive
bombing
of
yemen
,
prime
minister
david
cameron
boasted
about
the
"
brilliant
"
arms
,
components
,
and
other
military
technology
that
the
uk
would
continue
to
sell
to
saudi
arabia
,
oman
,
and
other
gulf
states
.
angus
robertson
,
the
snp
'

parliamentary
group
leader
,
said
david
cameron
should
admit
to
british
involvement
in
saudi
arabia
'
s
war
in
yemen
:
"
isn
'
t
it
time
for
the
prime

to
admit
that
britain
is
effectively
taking
part
in
a
war
in
yemen
that
is
costing
thousands
of
civilians
lives
and
he
has
not
sought
parliamentary
approval
to
do
this
?
"
a
few
months
later
,
leading
american
security
expert
bruce
riedel
noted
:
"
if
the
united

,
tonight
,
told

support
.
"
as
well
as
supplying
materiel
and
targeting
support
for
the
bombing
of
yemen
,
the
uk
has
assisted
the
coalition
diplomatically
.
for
example
,
the
uk
response
,
provided
by
middle
east
minister
tobias
ellwood
,
to
the
leaked
report
of
a
un
panel
in
january
2016
,
which
documented
more
than
one
hundred
instances
of
coalition
air
strikes
that
had
violated
international
law
,
was
to
say
that
the
saudis
had
made
"
mistakes
"
and
claim
that
other
cases
may
have
been
"
fabricated
"
by
the
houthis
.
theresa
may
succeeded
david
cameron
as
prime
minister
in
july
2016
,
but
maintained
her
predecessor
'
s
policy
because
,
she
claimed
,
close
ties
with
the
saudis
"
keep
people
on
the
streets
of
britain
safe
"
.
in
september
2016
,
her
foreign
minister
,
boris
johnson
,
refused
to
block
uk
arms
sales
to
saudi
arabia
,
saying
there
remained
no
clear
evidence
of
breaches
of
international
humanitarian
law
by
saudi
arabia
in
the
war
in
yemen
,
and
that
it
would
be
best
for
saudi
arabia
to
investigate
itself
.
amid
reports
from
yemen
of
famine
conditions
and
"
emaciated
children
[
.
.
.
]
fighting
for
their
lives
"
,
caat
observed
that
the
notion
of
self
-
investigation
would
rightly
never
pass
muster
if
it
were
proposed
for
russia
'
s
bombing
in
support
of
assad
in
syria
.
indeed
,
in
october
2016
,
boris
johnson
commended
the
notion
of
referring
allegations
of
russian
and
russian
-
backed
war
crimes
to
the
international
court
of
justice
.
the
previous
month
,
johnson
had
rejected
a
proposal
for
the
un
human
rights
council
to
conduct
an
inquiry
into
the
war
in
yemen
.
furthermore
,
britain
blocked
such
an
inquiry
from
taking
place
.
in
october
2016
,
it
emerged
that
the
united
kingdom
was
continuing
to
provide
instruction
to
pilots
of
the
royal
saudi
air
force
,
both
in
the
uk
and
in
saudi
arabia
.
andrew
mitchell
,
the
former
cabinet
minister
in
david
cameron
'
s
government
,
stated
that
"
britain
is
complicit
in
creating
"
a
famine
in
yemen
.
on
24
march
2019
,
the
british
newspaper
"
the
mail
on
sunday
"
reported
that
some
british
soldiers
have
been
involved
in
gun
battles
with
,
and
been
wounded
by
,
houthi
fighters
.
according
to
the
report
at
least
five
members
of
the
sbs
have
been
wounded
.
a
sbs
source
told
"
the

"
,
"
the
guys
are
fighting
in
the
inhospitable
desert

against
highly
committed

equipped
houthi

,
the

on
occasions
,
they
have
found
themselves
in

have
been
shot
"
.
the
report
also
claims
that
british
special
forces
are
fighting
on
the
same
side
as
jihadists
and
militia
which
use
child
soldiers
.
after
the
report
,
the
shadow
foreign
secretary
emily
thornberry
,
questioned
these
allegations
in
the
british
parliament
suggesting
that
the
british
forces
may
have
been
witnesses
to
war
crimes
,
if
the
allegations
were
true
.
she
claimed
that
as
many
as
40
%
of
the
soldiers
in
the
saudi
coalition
were
children
,
a
breach
of
international
humanitarian
law
.
in
response
,
the
uk
foreign
office
minister
mark
field
called
the
allegations
"
very
serious
and
well
sourced
"
and
promised
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
these
allegations
.
on
25
march
2019
mark
lancaster
told
the
uk
parliament
that
britain
'
s
royal
air
force
(
raf
)
was
providing
"
engineering
support
"
and
"
generic
training
"
to
saudi
arabian
military
.
according
to
the
guardian
news
agency
,
more
than
40
saudi
officers
have
been
trained
at
prestigious
british
military
colleges
since

the

refused

state
the

it
could
influence

priyanka

said
:
these
revelations
confirm
once
again
how
the

is
working

in

france
is
also
a
significant

it
has
supplied
over
2
billion

transformativism
transformativism
refers
to
the
method
of
making
a
flexible
centrist
coalition
of
government
which
isolated
the
extremes
of
the
left
and
the
right
in
italian
politics
after
the
unification
and
before
the
rise
of
benito
mussolini
and
fascism
.
the
policy
was
embraced
by
camillo
benso
,
count
of
cavour
and
the
historical
right
upon
italian
unification
and
carried
over
into
the
post
-
risorgimento
liberal
state
.
agostino
depretis
,
the
prime
minister
in
1883
who
was
a
member
of
the
left
continued
the
process
.
he
moved
to
the
right
and
reshuffled
his
government
to
include
marco
minghetti
'
s
liberal
-
conservatives
.
this
was
a
move
depretis
had
been
considering
for
a
while
.
the
aim
was
to
ensure
a
stable
government
that
would
avoid
weakening
the
institutions
by
extreme
shifts
to
the
left
or
right
and
ensuring
calm
in
italy
.
at
this
time
,
middle
class
politicians
were
concerned
more
with
making
deals
with
one
another
rather
than
with
political
philosophies
and
principles
.
large
coalitions
were
formed
with
members
being
bribed
to
join
them
.
the
liberals
,
the
main
political
group
,
was
tied
together
by
informal
gentleman
'
s
agreements
,
but
these
were
always
in
matters
of
enriching
themselves
.
actual
governing
did
not
seem
to
be
happening
at
all
,
but
limited
franchise
led
to
politicians
not
having
to
concern
themselves
with
the
interests
of
their
constituents
.
one
of
the
most
successful
politicians
was
giovanni
giolitti
,
who
succeeded
in
becoming
prime
minister
on
five
different
occasions
over
twenty
years
.
under
his
influence
the
liberals
did
not
develop
as
a
structured
party
,
instead
being
a
series
of
informal
personal
groupings
with
no
formal
links
to
political
constituencies
.
however
,
"
trasformismo
"
fed
into
the
debates
that
the
italian
parliamentary
system
was
weak
and
actually
failing
and
it
ultimately
became
associated
with
corruption
.
it
was
perceived
as
a
sacrifice
of
principles
and
policies
for
short
term
gain
.
the
system
of
"
trasformismo
"
was
little
loved
and
seemed
to
be
creating
a
huge
gap
between
politicians
and
their
constituents
.
this
system
brought
almost
no
advantages
,
as
illiteracy
remained
the
same
in
1912
as
before
the
unification
era
,
and
backward
economic
policies
combined
with
poor
sanitary
conditions
continued
to
prevent
the
country
'
s
rural
areas
from
improving
.
drawing
upon
antonio
gramsci
'
s
observations
of
italian
politics
and
history
,
canadian
historian
ian
mckay
has
suggested
that
"
trasformismo
"
has
also
played
an
important
role
in
canadian
politics
.
the
macdonald
cartier
coalition
,
the
basis
of
the
conservative
party
which
dominated
canadian
federal
politics
for
most
of
the
latter
half
of
the
19th
century
and
the
liberal
party
which
had
dominated
canadian
politics
for
the
20th
century
,
are
portrayed
as
examples
of
a
canadian
variant
of
"
trasformismo
"
.
in
the
1930s
,
professor
frank
h
.
underhill
of
the
university
of
toronto
also
argued
that
canada
'
s
two
major
political
parties
,
the
liberals
and
the
conservatives
,
had
operated
in

tourism
in
niger
there
is
relatively
limited
tourism
in
niger
.
most
of
the
tourism
industry
is
in
the
north
,
where
the
city
of
agadez
allows
access
to
the
desert
.
other
places
that
see
tourism
are
the
capital
city
,
niamey
,
areas
around
the
niger
river
,
and
reserves
such
as
kouré
which
is
known
for
west
african
giraffes
.
tourism
in
northern
niger
started
to
develop
in
the
1970s
.
tourism
dropped
during
the
tuareg
rebellion
in
the
early
90s
.
there
has
recently
been
travel
warnings
to
the
niger
because
of
terrorism
as
a
result
of
the
insurgency
in
the
sahel

condução
coercitiva
condução
coercitiva
is
a
compulsory
method
of
bringing
subjects
of
a
judicial
process
,
victims
,
witnesses
,
accused
parties
,
or
expert
subjects
into
the
presence
of
law
enforcement
or
judicial
authorities
against
their
wishes
.
this
is
a
measure
provided
for
in
the
penal
code
of
brazil
(
cpp
)
as
a
means
of
compelling
the
appearance
of
a
person
to
attend
an
action
to
which
he
was
summoned
,
but
who
failed
to
do
so
without
justification
.
according
to
some
jurists
,
this
is
a
form
of
short
-
term
"
precautionary
detention
"
(
)
whose
purpose
is
to
ensure
the
convenience
of
the
production
of
proof
.
if
equated
with
precautionary
detention
,
is
contrary
to
the
brazilian
constitution
of
1988
article
5
,
paragraph
lxi
,
even
though
the
procedure
is
in
the
penal
code
of
brazil
,
instituted
in
1941
.
the
cpp
authorizes
the
enforcement
of
the
of
victims
,
witnesses
,
defendants
,
and
experts
who
refuse
to
appear
in
court
,
and
who
may
even
be
handcuffed
and
brought
by
police
vehicle
.
article
218
of
the
cpp
refers
to
the
requirement
of
prior
summons
(
)
.
thus
,
some
argue
that
even
with
the
justification
of
providing
clarification
to
the
police
investigation
and
even
in
the
interests
of
justice
,
the
warrant
without
a
summons
violates
the
right
to
liberty
of
witnesses
and
defendants
.
according
to
this
line
of
thinking
,
the
only
ones
who
can
be
compelled
to
appear
by
a
are
those
witnesses
who
were
appropriately
summoned
beforehand
and
who
fail
to
attend
the
act
to
which
they
were
summoned
,
without
valid
cause
,
may
be
compelled
to
appear
via
a
warrant
.
there
is
some
controversy
concerning
the
exact
legal
foundation
and
even
constitutionality
of
the
warrant
.
from
a
legal
perspective
,
it
is
not
the
same
as
an
arrest
warrant
.

was
a
german
lutheran
theologian
.
gess
was
a
teacher
of
theology
in
basel
from
1850
to
1864
.
after
that
,
he
became
professor
of
systematic
theology
in

,
and
frpom

(

.
gess
entered
upon
his
duties
in

and
as
general
superintendent
of
the
old
prussian
,
he
headed
the
church
province
of

until

.
he
was
succeeded
by

,
and
settled
down
in

.
the
historian
felician
gess
(
1861

)
was
his
son
.
gess
is
known
as
the
main
representative
of
kenosis
.
his
main
work
was
"
the
scripture
doctrine
of
the
person
of
christ
.
"
(
1878
1887
)
.
rejecting
the
chalcedonian
definition
,
he
sees
christ
'
s
incarnation
as
a
transition
from
the
state
of
being
"
self
-
positing
"
to
the
state
of
"
being
posited

at
conception
,
logos
was
united
with
the
body
of
jesus
,
instead
of
god
creating
a
human
soul
,
as
he
does
with
other
men
.
the
logos
reduced
himself
to
what
was
compatible
with
existence
as
a
human
soul
.
controversially
,
gess
thinks
that
the
humanity
of
jesus
required
him
to
allow
his
self
-
consciousness
to
be
extinguished
at
birth
,
only
to
begin
to
flash
through
at
a
certain
stage
of
his
physical
maturity
,
and
then
developing
with
the
goal
of
sanctification
,
which
is
achieved
step
by
step
in
the
choices
he
freely
makes
.
furthermore
,
gess
argues
that
a
change
took
place
in
the
trinity
for
the
duration
of
the
incarnate
logos
'
earthly
life
.

spanish

left
the

unguarded
,

the
only
care
they
provided
were
food
shipments

but
the
food
they
supplied
was
insufficient
for

number
of

weather
could
prevent
the

food
for
weeks

some

approaches

he
sees
that

modenas

the
modenas
kr3
(
later
known
as
the
proton
kr3
)
was
a
racing
motorcycle
made
by
the
malaysian
motorcycle
company
modenas
.
the
bike
was
used
in
the
500cc
class
of
grand
prix
motorcycle
racing
from
1997
until
2001
,
when
the
company
got
taken
over
by
the
malaysian
automobile
company
proton
.
proton
renamed
the
bike
,
calling
it
the
proton
kr3
and
using
it
for
three
more
seasons
-
from
2002
to
2004
-
before
replacing
it
with
the
newer
proton
kr5
machine
.
the
origins
of
the
kr3
lie
with
the
strained
relationship
three
-
time
500cc
champion
kenny
roberts
had
with
the
factory
yamaha
team
at
the
time
.
after
wayne
rainey
became
paralysed
from
the
chest
down
due
to
a
crash
he
sustained
at
the
1993
italian
grand
prix
and
yamaha
'
s
rivals
honda
and
mick
doohan
took
multiple
titles
,
roberts
became
increasingly
unhappy
with
yamaha
'
s
working
method
in
the
mid
1990s
.
he
was
constantly
unhappy
with
the
progress
of
their
bikes
and
even
complained
many
times
publicly
that
the
factory
did
not
listen
to
his
feedback
on
how
to
improve
their
motorcycles
.
because
of
this
,
he
made
an
announcement
that
surprised
everyone
in
1996
he
was
breaking
away
from
the
factory
yamaha
team
-
after
25
years
of
close
collaboration
-
at
the
end
of
the
1996
season
,
working
together
with
the
modenas
company
to
create
a
new
motorcycle
for
the
newly
formed
team
roberts
in
1997
.
the
main
reasons
why
modenas
decided
to
work
together
with
roberts
was
for
two
reasons
:
the
company
hoped
that
some
of
the
technology
would
eventually
make
their
way
into
their
future
models
,
and
that
participation
in
the
500cc
would
make
their
brand
more
known
amongst
the
public
.
the
kr
team
decided
to
move
the
base
of
operations
to
the
"
motorsport
valley
"
in
the
united
kingdom
where
some
formula
1
and
race
car
teams
are
based
and
began
working
together
with
tom
walkinshaw
racing
(
twr
)
.
they
decided
to
create
a
unique
three
-
cylinder
,
two
-
stroke
,
500cc
machine
since
the
rules
at
the
time
gave
three
-
cylinder
machines
a
10kg
weight
advantage
over
the
usual
four
-
cylinder
bikes
.
the
idea
was
that
the
lower
weight
allowed
the
bike
to
be
more
agile
and
carry
more
speed
mid
-
corner
.
this
was
also
deemed
as
an
advantage
as
the
racetracks
during
this
time
had
more
corners
than
long
straights
for
the
four
-
cylinder
machines
to
utilize
,
some
examples
being
shah
alam
and
donington
park
.
however
,
they
also
were
aware
that
a
three
-
cylinder
bike
would
make
less
horsepower
compared
to
a
four
-
cylinder
one
.
to
solve
this
problem
,
the
team
focused
on
improving
volumetric
efficiency
(
how
much
fuel
-
air
mixture
the
engine
could
induct
)
.
the
engine
design
was
supervised
by
bud
askland
,
the
father
of
the
team
'
s
manager
chuck
askland
.
they
created
a
498cc
engine
with
"
square
"
dimensions
i
.
e
.

and

figures
of

mm
.
the
vee
-
angle
between
the
cylinders
was
set
at
nearly
180o
with
two
cylinders
down
below
and
one
up
top
.
the
frame
was
designed
to
give
the
bike
better
handling
characteristics
.
the
kr
team
worked
with
twr
and
french
chassis
maker
ftr
,
which
resulted
in
an
aluminium
twin
-
spar
"
deltabox
"
frame
that
'
s
smaller
and
lighter
than
conventional
japanese
designs
at
the
time
.
the
headstock
featured
eccentric
carriers
which
would
allow
adjustments
of
the
steering
'
s
rake
angle
and
trail
.
there
were
also
eccentric
carriers
in
the
swingarm
mount
which
were
created
to
adjust
the
height
of
the
swingarm
pivot
.
these
were
completely
new
and
unheard
of
at
the
time
.
even
the
fueling
system
was
ahead
of
its
time
,
the
team
adopting
electronic
carburetors
without
float
bowls
which
used
ducted
air
to
atomize
the
fuel
,
much
like
a
fuel
-
injection
system
.
kr
hoped
that
such
a
setup
would
avoid
the
fuel
from
emulsifying
from
intense
vibrations
.
arrow
made
an
exhaust
system
for
the
engine
.
the
result
of
this
was
an
engine
that
produced
160
hp
in
the
early
years
,
and
the
team
went
on
to
improve
the
engine
,
producing
180
hp
in
2002
.
the
bodywork
was
designed
in
such
a
way
that
it
would
wrap
tightly
around
the
frame
for
a
smaller
frontal
profile
.
consequently
,
the

balancing
inertial
forces
(
of
the

there

new

small
teams
such
as
the
kr
team
often
had
to
use
old
tyres
or
those
designed
for
other

,
sometimes
even
both
.
it
meant
that
kr
could
not
capitalize
on
their
handling
.
for
the
1998
season
,
bayle
was
replaced
with
ralf
waldmann
.
the
team
continued
to
underperform
all
throughout
the
year
,
but
did
better
than
its

year
and
scored
a
total

the

fast
in

and
there
were
other
riders
who
commented
that
they
were
led
into
entering
corners
too
fast
behind
it
.
however
,
when
the
situation
was
reversed
,
the
kr3
riders
found
themselves
blocked
by
the
slower
four

then
outgunned

in

,
along

three
replacement

;
josé
david
de

lost
its
marlboro

and
renamed
itself
before
the
start
of
the
season
,
going
by
the
name
of
"
proton
kr
modenas
"
after
proton
decided
to
sponsor
the
team
.
the
lack
of
experience
amongst
the
riders
did
not
help
and
the
team
only
scored
a
total
of
17
points
-
their
worst
result
ever
-
and
only
managed
a

once
more
in

,
earning
30
points
,
scoring
a
best

place
finish
of
eighth
and
finishing
sixth
in

.
in

,
proton
took
over
the

on
certain
occasions

overall
,
the

scored
65
points
,
managed
a

finished
fourth
in

,
equalling
the
result
of
its
debut
year
in
1997
.
2002
would
be
the
best
year
for
the
team
.
van
der
goorbergh
was
let
go
and
the
team
decided
to
get
two
regular
drivers
again
:
the
experienced
nobuatsu
aoki
and
jeremy
mcwilliams

along
with
david
garcía

first
provisional
pole
at

2002
german
grand

and
the
only
real
pole
position

performed
consistently
throughout

the
most
the

840
erzurum
earthquake
the
840
erzurum
earthquake
reportedly
took
place
in
the
city
of
qaliqala
(
modern
erzurum
)
.
the
primary
source
for
this
earthquake
is
the
chronicle
of
michael
the
syrian
(
12th
century
)
.
the
narrative
reports
that
it
took
place
on
a
friday
of
the
month
june
(
haziran
in
the
original
text
)
.
michael
dates
the
event
to
year
1151
of
the
seleucid
era
(
anno
graecorum
)
,
which
corresponds
to
the
year
840
anno
domini
.
according
to
michael
'
s
narrative
,
eight
towers
of
erzurum
'
s
defensive
wall
collapsed
due
to
the
earthquake
.
he
also
reports
the
collapse
of
many
houses
.
he
estimates
that
about
200
people
were
killed
by
the
earthquake
.
tremors
continued
for
two
months
following
the
initial
earthquakes
,
forcing
the
surviving
locals
to
move
to
the
city
'
s
fields
.
they
lived
in
fear
of
a
second
earthquake
.
the
armenian
epitome
of
michael
the
syrian
'
s
chronicle
omits
the
earthquake
.
the
original
chronicle
features
an
unreliable
chronology
,
so
there
are
doubts
concerning
the
date
and
location
of
this
earthquake
.
the
city
of
erzurum
has
been
reconstructed
several
times
.
no
archaeological
and
architectural
data
have
been
connected
to
this

,
kerala
.
after
the
outbreak
of
malabar
rebellion
in

the
british
army
and

were
forced

they
decided
to
attack
the
british

rebels
prepared
themselves
for
war
under
the
leadership
of

on

morning
,
rebels
reached
the
spot
,
british
force
came
in
22
lorries
and
25
cycles
.
the
rebels
'
strategy
was
to
let
their
lorries
enter
till
they
reach
pilakkal
,
then
to
besiege
them
from
all
the
sides
.
but
parancheri

field

hearing
the
gunshots

still
,
they
made
heavy
casualties
to
the
military
.
behind
the
veil
of
smoke
,
the
military
made
to
set
machine
guns
to
fire
.
when
the
smoke
subsided
,
about
ten
soldiers
walked
on
the
road
by
foot
towards
pilakkal
.
without
knowing
that
this
was
a
trap
,
rebels
came
forward
to
capture
them
.
soldiers
suddenly
turned
back
and
hid
behind
the
machine
guns
and
started
firing
.
the
rebels
who
followed
them
were
killed
.
this
round
of
firing
happened
two
times
and
a
number
of
rebels
got
killed
.
kunjarammutty
,
who
opened
fire
at
the
first
with
other
rebels
,
came
out
on
the
field
with
swords
when
they
had
no
more
bullets
in
stock
and
they
fought
unto
their
last
breath

the
late
moscovian
stage
of

carboniferous
period

million
years
ago
.
"
"
dendromaia
"
"
roughly
translates
to
"
the
mother
in
the
tree
"
,
according
to
its
discovery
in
a
stump
and
proposed
parental
care
.
the
specific
name
references
unama
'
kik
,
the
mi
'
kmaq
name
for
cape
breton
island
.
the
genus
and
species
were
described
by
hillary
maddin
,
arjan
mann
,
and
brian
hebert
in
2019
.
hebert
had
discovered
the
specimen
in
2017
.
the
two
skeletons
had
different
sizes
and
preserved
different
areas
,
with
the
larger
skeleton
(
designated
the
holotype
)
incorporating
a
large
portion
of
the
rear
half
of
the
body
and
the
smaller
skeleton
(
designated
the
paratype
)
including
a
skull
and
only
fragments
of
the
postcranium
,
1
/
4th
the
size
of
the
larger
one
.
these
skeletons
were
inferred
to
represent
two
individuals
of
a
single
new
taxon
based
on
their
similar
overlapping
anatomy
,
apparent
varanopid
ancestry
,
close
association
,
and
the
fact
that
there
are
no
other
varanopids
known
from
nova
scotia
.
the
6
preserved
dorsal
vertebrae
of
the
larger
skeleton
were
among
the
most
characteristic
bones
in
the
animal
.
they
shared
several
traits
with
"
mycterosaurus
"
,
such
as
tall
rectangular
neural
spines
with
slight
depressions
at
their
base
.
however
,
the
rib
facets
at
the
tip
of
the
transverse
processes
were
not
vertical
,
but
instead
oriented
diagonally
.
like
other
non
-
varanodontine
varanopids
,
the
lower
edge
of
each
centrum
had
a
rounded
keel
.
10
incomplete
caudal
vertebrae
preserved
on
the
counterpart
were
elongated
and
had
low
neural
spines
.
holocephalous
(
single
-
headed
)
ribs
and
"
heleosaurus
"
-
like
gastralia
were
also
present
,
though
osteoderms
were
seemingly
absent
.
the
plate
-
like
bones
composing
the
pelvis
were
not
fused
to
each
other
,
and
"
dendromaia
"
had
a
large
pubic
foramen
like
that
of
"
heleosaurus
"
.
the
femur
was
lightly
-
built
and
twisted
,
similar
to
mycterosaurines
.
the
rest
of
the
leg
and
foot
was
present
but
incomplete
.
the
larger
specimen
may
have
been
20
to
30
centimeters
(
7
.
9
-
12
inches
)
long
from
the
tip
of
the
snout
to
the
base
of
the
tail
,
and
its
full
tail
length
is
unknown
but
likely
elongated
.
the
small
skeleton
'
s
poorly
-
preserved
skull
was
triangular
and
pointed
like
those
of
"
archaeovenator
"
,
"
pyozia
"
,
and
"
heleosaurus
"
.
it
had
thin
,
curved
teeth
on
the
maxilla
(
without
a
canine
region
)
and
smaller
teeth
on
the
palate
,
which
also
possessed
a
varanopid
-
like
pterygoid
and
cultriform
process
.
isolated
hyoid
bones
were
also
identifiable
.
like
the
larger
skeleton
,
the
small
skeleton
'
s
vertebrae
had
a
rounded
keel
on
their
underside
.
it
also
possessed
several
limb
bone
fragments
,
including
a
twisted
humerus
.
"
dendromaia
"
is
the
oldest
member
of
a
family
of
amniotes
known
as
varanopids
.
varanopids
are
traditionally
considered
early
synapsids
(
part
of
the
lineage
of
amniotes
leading
to
mammals
)
,
although
some
studies
alternatively
propose
that
they
are
diapsid
reptiles
related
to
"
orovenator
"
.
the
describers
of
"
dendromaia
"
prefer
a
position
for
varanopids
among
synapsids
,
citing
both
biological
characteristics
(
parental
care
)
and
arguing
that
traits
which
link
varanopids
to
diapsids
may
be
based
on
oversampling
of
juvenile
specimens
at
the
base
of
varanopidae
.
to
investigate
the
position
of
"
dendromaia
"
among
other
varanopids
,
the
describers
adapted
a
phylogenetic
analysis
matrix
previously
utilized
by
brocklehurst
&
fröbisch
(
2018
)
.
the
resulting
strict
consensus
tree
(
average
result
of
most
parsimonious
trees
)
of
the
parsimony
analysis
placed
"
dendromaia
"
in
a
polytomy
near
the
base
of
varanopidae
,
along
with
"
pyozia
"
and
a
clade
which
forks
into
varanodontinae
and
mycterosaurinae
.
the
bayesian
analysis
recovers
a
similar
result
,
albeit
with
the
polytomy
resolved
,
placing
"
dendromaia
"
as
the
sister
taxon
to
"
pyozia
"
.
the
following
cladogram
is
based
on
the
results
of
the
bayesian
analysis
in
maddin
,
mann
,
&
hebert
(
2019
)
:
the
delicate
preservation
of
the
skeletons
indicated
that
they
likely
died
and
were
quickly
buried
at
the
same
place
and
time
.
they
were
positioned
with
the
smaller
skeleton
encircled
by
the
tail
of
the
larger
skeleton
.
these
taphonomic
qualities
led
the
paleontologists
who
described
them
to
propose
that
the
two
skeletons
were
denning
together
under
the
roots
of
a
lycopod
tree
,
with
the
smaller
skeleton
likely
representing
the
offspring
of
the
larger
skeleton
.
this
may
be
the
oldest
fossil
evidence
of
parental
care
,
predating
the
previously
oldest
evidence
,
an
aggregation
of
varanopids
from
the
permian
of
south
africa
which
may
represent
their
own
species
(
"
microvaranops
parentis
"
)
or
specimens
of
"
heleosaurus
scholtzi
"
.
on
the
other
hand
,
it
remains
a
possibility
that
the
two
skeletons
were
not
close
relatives
,
and
instead
simply
sheltered
from
a
storm
in
the
same
stump
.
the
anatomy
of
the
juvenile
"
dendromaia
"
skeleton
is
remarkably
similar
to
that
of
basal
varanopids
such
as
"
archaeovenator
"
and
"
pyozia
"
,
indicating
that
these
genera
may
be
based
on
juvenile
specimens
of
larger
varanopids
.
likewise
,
certain
characteristics
(
such
as
reduced
dentition
and
limb
development
)
found
to
link
basal
varanopids
with
diapsids
may
be
a
consequence
of
juvenile
specimen
sampling
,
rather
than
valid
phylogenetic
signals
.

the
laying

hit
the
surveillance

but
due
to
the
poor
quality

,
the
only
thing
that
could
be
determined
was
the
model
of
the
car
.
it
was

.
at
that
time
,
there
were
800
such
cars
in

all
owners

were
summoned
for
interrogations

among
them
was
mikhail
denisenko
.
ilya
galkin
knew
that
they
were
looking
for
denisenko
s
car
and
organized
an
explosion
on

he
disguised
the

after
galkin
became

pick
up
his

the
boss
noticed
how
galkin
plays
games
on

laptop
in
time

took
it
from
him

galkin
panicked
.
the
laptop
had
a
lot
of
information
about
explosives
.
it
was
april

that
evening
he
told
everything
to
his
mother

he
lived

they
collected
all
the
materials
for
the
explosives

took
them
to

the
organizer

inspirer
of
the
explosions
was
galkin
.
galkin
and
denisenko
were
neighbors
and
were
friends
since
childhood
.
at
school
,
they
were
bullied
.
denisenko
was
very
dependent
on
galkin
.
they
were
prone
to
cruelty
.
they
found
instructions
for
making
explosives
on
the
internet
.
both
were
united
by
hatred
of
society

(
artist

max
geller
is
an
american
performance
artist

human
rights
activist
,
trickster
,
and
provocateur
.
born
january
2
,
1984
,
in
brookline
,
massachusetts
,
geller
is
an
outspoken
voice
on
the
jewish
left
,
an
organizer
and
activist
for
the
bds
movement
and
palestinian
human
rights
,
and
a
frequent
speaker
against
zionism
,
as
well
as
antisemitism
.
despite
the
disproportionate
amount
of
attention
white
jews
get
for
speaking
out
against
israel
,
geller
has
consistently
emphasized
the
need
to
center
palestinians
in
the
struggle
for
their
own
liberation
.
geller
s
activism
often
employs
non
-
traditional
tactics
,
drawing
on
performance
art
,
erudite
references
and
irony
to
provoke
social
discomfort
without
expressing
an
explicit
political
agenda
.
his
performance
art
,
on
the
other
hand
,
frequently
relies
on
methods
of
activism
,
blurring
any
distinction
between
art
and
politics
.
most
famously
,
geller
is
the
founder
of
#
renoirsucksatpainting
,
a
tongue
-
in
-
cheek
social
movement
to
remove
the
paintings
of
auguste
renoir
from
museums
around
the
world
.
he
has
frequently
leveraged
the
"
renoir
sucks
at
painting
"
project
into
media
coverage
for
the
bds
movement
and
other
social
causes
.
at
sixteen
,
geller
was
arrested
for
burning
an
american
flag
on
the
4th
of
july
and
draping
the
charred
remains
over
the
liberty
bell
at
town
hall
in
brookline
.
.
for
his
senior
capstone
project
at
his
small
arts
high
school
,
geller
learned
aikido
,
and
demonstrated
his
mastery
by
fighting
his
mother
.
in
college
,
geller
conned
his
way
into
an
appearance
on
the
daytime
television
show
judge
mathis
.
the
performance
put
on
by
geller
s
troupe
,
filled
with
outrageous
claims
,
false
hysterics
,
and
demands
for
justice
,
mocks
both
reality
television
and
the
criminal
justice
system
.
in
2005
,
george
edward
jed
smock
,
jr
.
aka
brother
jed
,
came
to
protest
liberal
values
at
the
colorado
college
campus
.
geller
showed
up
dressed
in
klansman
robes
and
joined
brother
jed
s
rally
,
thus
aligning
jed
s
crusade
with
the
overt
white
supremacy
associated
with
the
kkk
.
later
geller
distanced
himself
from
the
early
performance
due
to
its
racial
insensitivity
.
in
2007
,
while
traveling
the
world
,
geller
arrived
in
palestine
,
where
the
struggle
of
the
palestinians
for
their
own
liberation
,
and
israel
s
violent
response
,
left
an
indelible
mark
on
him
.
he
returned
to
palestine
several
times
over
the
course
of
the
next
few
years
,
and
later
continued
his
activism
back
in
the
usa
,
where
he
has
been
an
active
member
of
many
groups
organizing
on
behalf
of
palestinian
liberation
,
such
as
nsjp
,
ijan
,
uscpr
,
and
others
,
and
has
been
a
frequent
contributor
to
a
variety
of
conferences
and
journals
.
in
2009
,
geller
joined
a
group
of
international
palestinian
activists
who
were
attempting
to
break
the
blockade
of
gaza
.
after
being
turned
away
at
the
border
,
geller
and
his
cohort
scaled
the
walls
of
the
pyramid
of
giza
and
flew
an
enormous
palestinian
flag
from
halfway
up
.
the
image
became
an
iconic
representation
of
the
attempts
to
break
the
blockade
and
was
featured
in
newspapers
throughout
the
arab
world
.
while
geller
was
a
student
at
north
eastern
law
school
,
he
became
president
of
the
local
chapter
of
students
for
justice
in
palestine
,
where
he
staged
a
series
of
interventions
to
bring
awareness
to
the
cause
.
these
culminated
in
the
group
delivering
mock
eviction
letters
to
students
that
resulted
in
sjp
being
suspended
by
the
administration
.
geller
immediately
took
the
case
to
the
national
media
gaining
widespread
attention
for
the
incident
,
defending
the
incident
in
an
op
-
ed
in
the
boston
globe
and
an
appearance
on
democracy
now
.
in
2017
,
geller
was
instrumental
in
the
new
orleans
palestinian
solidarity
committee
'
s
successful
lobbying
of
the
city
council
to
pass
a
boycott
divestment
and
sanctions
bill
in
solidarity
with
the
palestinian
cause
.
because
the
legislation
didn
t
explicitly
name
israel
,
opting
instead
to
target
human
-
rights
violators
,
zionist
groups
claimed
that
the
nopsc
had
tricked
the
city
council
into
passing
the
resolution
and
after
fierce
counter
-
lobbying
from
powerful
pro
-
israel
forces
,
the
city
council
rescinded
the
resolution
.
in
addition
to
geller
s
history
as
a
political
provocateur
,
he
has
also
used
his
knack
for
creating
viral
ideas
and
images
to
mount
ambiguous
,
seemingly
frivolous
interventions
in
the
art
and
music
world
.
often
,
geller
uses
these
absurdist
actions
to
build
a
platform
to
raise
other
,
more
serious
cultural
and
political
issues
.
the
most
famous
example
is
#
renoirsucksatpainting
.
in
february
of
2015
geller
created
the
instagram
@
renoir_sucks_at_painting
,
and
began
posting
images
of
renoir
paintings
and
captioning
them
with
a
combination
of
sardonic
wit
and
vitriol
.
soon
after
,
the
account
began
to
go
viral
,
attracting
the
attention
of
reddit
streams
,
content
aggregators
,
art
critics
,
and
renoir
s
own
descendants
.
at
the
same
time
,
geller
began
to
use
the
platform
to
make
larger
political
critiques
.
when
renoir
s
great
-
great
-
granddaughter
responded
to
an
instagram
post
in
may
of
2015
saying
when
your
great
-
great
-
grandfather
paints
anything

.
1

.
.
.
then
you
can
criticize
.
in
the
mean
time
[

]
,
it
is
safe
to
say
that
the
free
market
has
spoken
and
renoir
did
not
suck
at

have
all
been
unleashed
upon
us
by
the
free
market
.
through
this
exchange
,
the
account
began
to
gain
significant
media
attention
.
on
october
5
,
2015
,
at
the
museum
of
fine
arts
boston
,
geller
organized
the
first
of
what
would
become
many
major
anti
-
renoir
protests
.
when
the
protest
garnered
criticism
in
the
boston
globe
by
sebastian
smee
,
a
pulitzer
prize
-
winning
art
critic
,
geller
responded
by
publicly
challenging
smee
to
a
duel
.
the
feud
quickly
gained
national
attention
,
and
along
with
a
second
protest
at
the
metropolitan
museum
of
new
york
a
week
later
,
helped
skyrocket
the
movement
to
headlines
across
the
globe
.
geller
continued
traveling
the
country
organizing
anti
-
renoir
protests
at
art
museums
in
major
cities
around
the
country
.
after
a
protest
at
the
art
institute
of
chicago
,
geller
was
a
guest
on
a
local
news
station
there
,
where
he
once
again
expanded
the
focus
of
his
movement
from
renoir
s
paintings
themselves
to
the
misogyny
and
white
supremacy
of
the
canon
at
large
.
at
the
end
of
the
day
,
he
said
,
it
s
about
access
,
who
has
access
to
our
museums
i
think
the
art
institute
should
sell
some
of
these
renoirs
.
.
.
and
instead
buy
some
art
that
is
painted
by
women
or
people
of
color
.
many
in
the
media
began
to
realize
the
renoir
sucks
movement
was
part
of
the
growing
ouvre
of
protests
and
performance
art
from
geller
.
while
the
movement
reached
its
apex
in
the
fall
of
2015
,
it
has
continued
to
spawn
mini
-
protests
all
over
the
world
,
including
at
the
white
house
where
president
trump
is
an
admirer
of
renoir
.
art
critics
are
still
grappling
with
the
after
-
effects
of
the
movement
as
recently
as
june
of
2019
.
while
"
renoir
sucks
at
painting
"
is
geller
'
s
most
well
known
aesthetic
protest
,
there
were
any
smaller
ones
that
preceded
it
.
in
addition
to
the
array
of
staged
satirical
public
performances
,
geller
also
has
a
history
of
spontaneous
confrontations
with
politicians
.
much
of
geller
s
work
remain
unrecognized
today
,
and
the
motives
and
consequences
are
still
unexamined
.
it
is
difficult
to
know
which
actions
ought
to
be
understood
as
art
,
protest
,
or
something
else
entirely
.
examples
include
a
drag
performance
in
provincetown
called
the
angry
geisha
in
2007
,
the
sinking
of
an
old
wooden

expressways

the
expressway
network
of

is
a
recent
addition
to
the
transport
network
of
vietnam
.
the
first
expressways
were
opened
in
the
mid
-
2000s
,
by
2020
,
the
expressway
network
is
expected
to
stretch
and
plans
are
for
over
of
expressway
by
2030
.
expressways
are
a
rather
recent
addition
to
the
vietnamese
road
network
,
and
standardization
has
not
been
fully
implemented
.
ownership
varies
by
expressway
,
they
are
financed
,
developed
,
owned
and
operated
by
either
state

private
companies

the
ministry

for
example
,
state

owned
vietnam
expressway
corporation
owns
and
exploits
four
expressways
,
but
toll
collection
is
done
by
subcontracted
companies
.
the
companies
exploiting
the
expressways
have
to
report
traffic
numbers
and
toll
revenue
to
the
ministry
of
transport
and
the
directorate
for
roads
of
vietnam
.
this
construction
has
been
subject
of
fraud
investigations
several
times
,
as
toll
revenue
was
falsified
by
the
collecting
companies
in
order
to
take
advantage
of
the
difference
.
the
government
has
also
threatened
operating
companies
to
revoke
their
toll
collection
licence
after
lack
of
maintenance
caused
dangerous
situations
on
several
expressways
.
in
2019
it
was
reported
that
the
vietnam
expressway
corporation
was
$

in
debt

earning

each
year

the
total
cost
of
the
planned
expressway

at

generally

in
the
creation
of
a
cultivated
and
witty
conviviality
,
the
duchess
was
assisted
by
poet
and
philosopher
christoph
martin

,
who
had
joined

not
until
the
late
20th
century
had
this
idea
of
a
weimar
courtyard
of
the
muses
been
contested
and
dismissed
as
pseudoscientific
19th
century
legend
formation
and
romanticism
.
contemporary
sources
of
the
classical
weimar
court
never
referred
to
a
courtyard
of
the
muses
and
duchess
anna
amalia
is
not
known
to
have
at
any
time
discontinued
standard
court
ceremony
or
contested
common
class
regulations
.
her
role
as
pioneer
of
weimar
classicism
has
been
challenged
by
author
j

berger
,
as
he
points
out
that
the
duchess
has
given
the
primacy
of
the
arts
not
to
literature
but
to
music
.
berger
also
exhorts
,
that
she
does
not
qualify
as
a
true
patroness
of
the
arts
because
she
refused
unconditional
promotion
of
free
artists
,
but
treated
them
as
civil
servants
who
were
obliged
to
perform
certain
tasks
.
however
,
according
to
author
j
.
h
.
ulbricht
,
all
these
scientific
disenchantments
have
failed
to
notably
penetrate
the
communicative
and
cultural
memory
of
the
public
.
the
narrative
of
the
"
historiographically
colorful
idyll
"
of
classical
weimar
begins
with
anna
amalias
death
and
continues
to
be
told
until
1993
.
already
in
1807
,
shortly
after
her
burial
,
goethe
sought
the
opportunity
to
advertize
weimar
'
s
cultural
prowess
via
the
duchess
'
obituary
,
that
he
published
in
a
series
of
journals
.
the
second
volume
of
a
1908
trilogy
on
the
life
of
anna
amalia
is
titled
:
"
duchess
amalies
courtyard
of
the
muses
"
and
has
been
published
repeatedly
under
this
name
.
in
1844
the
academic
historian
wilhelm
wachsmuth
published
a
"
historical
sketch
"
in
which
the
term
"
courtyard
of
the
muses
"
was
used
for
the
first
time
in
a
scholarly
context
,
steadily
spread
for
decades
and
solidified
into
a
formula
.
eventually
,
in
a
1993
typology
attempt
the
term
"
courtyard
of
the
muses
"
was
determined
as
one
of
five
types
of
european
courts
and
weimar
was
referred
to
as
the
"
courtyard

events

)
refers
to
a
series
of
demonstrations
and
riots
in
late
august
1929
when
a
long
-
running
dispute
between
muslims
and
jews
over
access
to
the
western
wall
in
jerusalem
escalated
into
violence
.
the
riots
took
the
form
,
in
the
most
part
,
of
attacks
by
arabs
on
jews
accompanied
by
destruction
of
jewish
property
.
during
the
week
of
riots
from
23
to
29
august
,
133
jews
were
killed
and
between
198
241
others
were
injured
,
a
large
majority
of
whom
were
unarmed
and
were
murdered
in
their
homes
by
arabs
,
while
at
least
116
arabs
were
killed
and
at
least
232
were
injured
,
mostly
by
the
british
police
while
trying
to
suppress
the
riots
,
although
around
20
were
killed
by
jewish
attacks
or
indiscriminate
british
gunfire
.
on
the
first
day
of
the
riots
,
the
british
government
had
enlisted
and
armed
41
jewish
special
constables
,
18
jewish
ex
-
soldiers
and
a
further
60
jews
were
issued
staves
.
during
the
riots
,
17
jewish
communities
were
evacuated
.
the
british
-
appointed
shaw
commission
found
that
the
fundamental
cause
of
the
violence
"
without
which
in
our
opinion
disturbances
either
would
not
have
occurred
or
would
not
have
been
little
more
than
a
local
riot
,
is
the
arab
feeling
of
animosity
and
hostility
towards
the
jews
consequent
upon
the
disappointment
of
their
political
and
national
aspirations
and
fear
for
their
economic
future
,
as
well
as
arab
fears
of
jewish
immigrants
"
not
only
as
a
menace
to
their
livelihood
but
as
a
possible
overlord
of
the
future
.
"
with
respect
to
the
triggering
of
the
riots
,
the
commission
found
that
the
incident
which
"
contributed
most
to
the
outbreak
was
the
jewish
demonstration
at
the
wailing
wall
on
15
august
1929
"
.
avraham
sela
described
the
riots
as
"
unprecedented
in
the
history
of
the
arab
-
jewish
conflict
in
palestine
,
in
duration
,
geographical
scope
and
direct
damage
to
life
and
property
.
"
the
western
wall
is
one
of
the
holiest
of
jewish
sites
,
considered
by
jews
to
be
a
remnant
of
the
ancient
second
temple
compound
destroyed
in
70
ce
.
the
jews
,
through
the
practice
of
centuries
,
had
established
a
right
of
access
to
the
wailing
wall
for
the
purposes
of
their
devotions
.
as
part
of
the
temple
mount
the
western
wall
was
under
the
control
of
the
muslim
religious
trust
,
the
waqf
.
muslims
consider
the
wall
to
be
part
of
the
al
-
aqsa
mosque
,
the
third
holiest
site
in
islam
,
and
according
to
islamic
tradition
the
place
where
muhammad
tied
his
horse
,
buraq
,
before
his
night
journey
to
heaven
.
there
had
been
a
few
serious
incidents
resulting
from
these
differences
.
as
a
result
of
an
incident
,
which
occurred
in
september
1925
,
a
ruling
was
made
which
forbade
the
jews
to
bring
seats
and
benches
to
the
wall
even
though
these
were
intended
for
worshippers
who
were
aged
and
infirm
.
the
muslims
linked
any
adaptions
to
the
site
with
"
the
zionist
project
,
"
and
feared
that
they
would
be
the
first
step
in
turning
the
site
into
a
synagogue
and
taking
it
over
.
several
months
earlier
zionist
leader
menachem
ussishkin
gave
a
speech
demanding
"
a
jewish
state
without
compromises
and
without
concessions
,
from
dan
to
be
'
er
sheva
,
from
the
great
sea
to
the
desert
,
including
transjordan
.
"
he
concluded
,
"
let
us
swear
that
the
jewish
people
will
not
rest
and
will
not
remain
silent
until
its
national
home
is
built
on
our
mt
moriah
,
"
a
reference
to
the
temple
mount
.
in
september
1928
,
jews
praying
at
the
wall
on
yom
kippur
placed
chairs
and
a
mechitza
that
looked
like
a
simple
room
divider
of
cloth
covering
a
few
wooden
frames
to
separate
the
men
and
women
.
jerusalem
'
s
british
commissioner
edward
keith
-
roach
,
while
visiting
a
muslim
religious
court
building
overlooking
the
prayer
area
,
mentioned
to
a
constable
that
he
had
never
seen
it
at
the
wall
before
,
although
the
constable
had
seen
it
earlier
that
day
and
had
not
given
it
any
attention
.
the
sheikhs
hosting
the
commissioner
immediately
protested
the
screen
on
the
grounds
that
it
violated
the
ottoman
"
status
quo
"
forbidding
jews
from
bringing
physical
structures
,
even
temporary
furniture
,
into
the
area
due
to
muslim
fears
of
zionist
expropriation
of
the
site
.
the
sheikhs
disclaimed
responsibility
for
what
could
happen
if
the
screen
was
not
taken
down
,
and
keith
-
roach
told
the
ashkenazic
beadle
to
remove
the
screen
because
of
the
arabs
'
demands
.
the
beadle
requested
that
the
screen
remained
standing
until
the
end
of
the
prayer
service
,
to
which
keith
-
roach
agreed
.
while
the
commissioner
was
visiting
a
synagogue
,
attorney
general
norman
bentwich
had
his
request
to
keep
the
screen
until
after
the
fast
rejected
by
the
commissioner
,
who
ordered
the
constable
to
ensure
it
was
removed
by
morning
.
the
constable
feared
the
screen
meant
trouble
,
and
had
the
commissioners
order
signed
and
officially
stamped
,
speaking
again
with
the
beadle
that
evening
.
when
the
screen
remained
in
the
morning
,
the
constable
sent
ten
armed
policemen
to
remove
it
.
the
policemen
charged
the
small
group
near
the
screen
and
were
urged
by
nearby
arab
residents
to
attack
the
assembled
jews
.
jewish
worshipers
who
had
gathered
began
to
attack
the
policemen
.
the
screen
was
eventually
destroyed
by
the
policemen
.
the
constable
had
infuriated
his
superiors
due
to
his
use
of
excessive
force
without
good
judgement
,
but
the
british
government
later
issued
a
statement
defending
his
actions
.
although
screens
had
been
set
up
temporarily
at
the
site
before
,
and
other
prohibitions
were
ignored
or
relaxed
at
times
,
the
violent
confrontation
over
the
latest
screen
would
engender
further
violence
.
the
internal
politics
of
both
sides
were
also
willing
to
adopt
extreme
positions
and
make
use
of
religious
symbols
to
whip
up
popular
support
.
zionist
literature
published
throughout
the
world
used
the
imagery
of
a
domed
structure
on
the
temple
mount
to
symbolize
their
national
aspirations
.
a
zionist
flag
was
depicted
atop
of
a
building
very
reminiscent
of
the
dome
of
the
rock
in
one
publication
,
which
was
later
picked
up
and
redistributed
by
arab
propagandists
.
haj
amin
al
husseini
,
the
mufti
of
jerusalem
distributed
leaflets
to
arabs
in
palestine
and
throughout
the
arab
world
which
claimed
that
the
jews
were
planning
to
take
over
the
al
-
aqsa
mosque
.
the
leaflet
stated
that
the
government
was
"
responsible
for
any
consequences
of
any
measures
which
the
moslems
may
adopt
for
the
purpose
of
defending
the
holy
burak
themselves
in
the
event
of
the
failure
of
the
government
.
.
.
to
prevent
any
such
intrusion
on
the
part
of
the
jews
.
"
a
memorandum
issued
by
the
moslem
supreme
council
stated
,
"
having
realized
by
bitter
experience
the
unlimited
greedy
aspirations
of
the
jews
in
this
respect
,
moslems
believe
that
the
jews
aim
is
to
take
possession
of
the
mosque
of
al
-
aqsa
gradually
on
the
pretence
that
it
is
the
temple
,
"
and
it
advised
the
jews
"
to
stop
this
hostile
propaganda
which
will
naturally
engender
a
parallel
action
in
the
whole
moslem
world
,
the
responsibility
for
which
will
rest
with
the
jews
.
"
the
shaw
commission
stated
that
some
sections
of
the
arabic
press
had
reproduced
documents
concerning
the
wailing
wall
which
"
were
of
a
character
likely
to
excite
any
susceptible
readers
.
"
in
addition
,
it
stated
that
"
there
appeared
in
the
arabic
press
a
number
of
articles
,
which
,
had
they
been
published
in
england
or
in
other
western
countries
,
would
unquestionably
have
been
regarded
as
provocative
.
"
one
consequence
was
that
jewish
worshippers
frequently
were
subjected
to
beatings
and
stoning
.
in
october
1928
,
the
grand
mufti
organised
new
construction
next
to
and
above
the
wall
.
mules
were
driven
through
the
praying
area
often
dropping
excrement
,
and
waste
water
was
thrown
on
jews
.
a
muezzin
was
appointed
to
perform
the
islamic
call
to
prayer
directly
next
to
the
wall
,
creating
noise
exactly
when
the
jews
were
conducting
their
prayers
.
the
jews
protested
at
these
provocations
and
tensions
increased
.
zionists
began
making
demands
for
control
over
the
wall
;
some
went
as
far
as
to
call
openly
for
the
rebuilding
of
the
temple
,
increasing
muslim
fears
over
zionist
intentions
.
ben
-
gurion
said
the
wall
should
be
redeemed
,
predicting
it
could
be
achieved
in
as
little
as
another
half
a
year
.
during
the
spring
of
1929
the
revisionist
newspaper
edited
by
right
-
wing
leader
ze
'
ev
jabotinsky
,
ran
a
long
campaign
claiming
jewish
rights
over
the
wall
and
its
pavement
,
going
as
far
as
calling
for
"
insubordination
and
violence
,
"
and
pleading
that
jews
not
stop
protesting
and
demonstrating
until
the
wall
is
"
restored
to
us
.
"
on
6
august
the
british
palestine
police
force
established
a
police
post
beside
the
wall
.
on
14
august
the
haganah
and
brit
trumpeldor
held
a
meeting
in

attended
by
6
,

people
objecting
to
1928
commission
'
s
conclusion
that
the
wall
was
muslim
property
.
joseph
klausner
who
formed
the
"
pro
wailing
wall
committee
"
helped
organize
several
demonstrations
,
beginning
on
14
august
1929
when
6
,
000
youths
marched
around
the
wall
of
the
old
city
of
jerusalem
.
on
thursday
,
15

,
during
the
jewish
fast
of
tisha
b

,
several
hundred
members
of

wing
group
described
by
professor
michael

cohen
as
"
brawny
youths
with

"
marched
to
the
western
wall
shouting
"
the
wall
is
ours
,
"
raised
the
jewish
national
flag
,
sang
hatikvah
(
the
jewish
anthem
)
.
the
group
included
members
of
vladimir
jabotinsky

s
revisionist
zionism
movement
betar
youth
organization
,
under
the
leadership
of
jeremiah
halpern
.
rumors
circulated
among
the
arabs
that
the
procession
attacked
local
residents
and
cursed
the
name
of
the
prophet
muhammad
.
the
shaw
report
later
concluded
that
the
crowd
was
peaceful
and
allegations
that
the
crowd
were
armed
with
iron
bars
were
not
correct
,
but
that
there
may
have
been
threatening
cries
made
by
some
"
undesirable
elements
"
in
the
jewish
procession
.
leaders
of
the
palestine
zionist
executive
were
reportedly
alarmed
by
the
activities
of
the
revisionists
as
well
as
"
embarrassed
"
and
fearful
of
an
"
accident
"
and
had
notified
the
authorities
of
the
march
in

,
who
provided
a
heavy
police
escort
in
a
bid
to
prevent
any
incidents
.
on
friday
,
16
august
after
a
sermon
,
a
demonstration
organized
by
the
supreme
muslim
council
marched
to
the
wall
.
the
acting
high
commissioner
summoned
mufti
haj
amin
al
-
husseini
and
informed
him
that
he
had
never
heard
of
such
a
demonstration
being
held
at
the
wailing
wall
,
and
that
it
would
be
a
terrible
shock
to
the
jews
who
regarded
the
wall
as
a
place
of
special
sanctity
to
them
.
at
the
wall
,
the
crowd
burnt
prayer
books
,
liturgical
fixtures
and
notes
of
supplication
left
in
the
wall
'
s
cracks
,
and
the
beadle
was
injured
.
the
demonstrations
spread
to
the
jewish
commercial
area
of
town
.
inflammatory
articles
calculated
to
incite
disorder
appeared
in
the
arab
media
and
one
flyer
,
signed
by
"
the
committee
of
the
holy
warriors
in
palestine
"
stated
that
the
jews
had
violated
the
honor
of
islam
,
and
declared
:
"
hearts
are
in
tumult
because
of

"
on

afternoon
,
the
jewish
newspaper
"

of
which
jabotinsky
was

published
an
inflammatory

an
article
entitled

"
:
"
the
poison

dripping
from

daily
until

poisoned

brought
about

wild
demonstration

the
next
day
an
incident
which
"
in
its
origin
was
of
a
personal
nature

was
sparked
when
a
17
year
old
sephardic
jew
named
abraham
mizrachi
was
fatally
stabbed
by
an
arab
at

and
the
bukharim
quarter
,
on
the
outskirts

began
when

and
his
friends
tried
to
retrieve
their
lost
football
from
an
arab
girl
after
it
has
rolled
into
an

tomato
field

a
jewish
crowd
attacked
and
severely
wounded
the
policeman
who
arrived
to
arrest
the
arab
responsible
,
and
then
attacked
and
burned
neighbouring
arab
tents

included
an

was
chosen
at

to
be
stabbed
in
retaliation

mizrachi
died
on
20

and
his
funeral
became
the
occasion
for
a
serious
anti

arab
demonstration

it
was
suppressed
by
the

force
that
had
been
employed
in

"
the
next
friday
,
23
august
,
thousands
of
arab
villagers
streamed
into
jerusalem
from
the
surrounding
countryside
to
pray
at
the
al
-
aqsa
mosque
,
many
armed
with
sticks
and
knives
.
the
gathering
was
prompted
by
rumors
that
the
zionists
were
going
to
march
to
the
temple
mount
and
claim
ownership
,
as
they
had
belligerently
marched
on
the
western
wall
demanding
jewish
ownership
9
days
earlier
.

:

began
closing
shop
and
at

:
00
,
20
30
gunshots
were
heard
on
the
temple
mount
,
apparently
to
work
up
the
crowd
.
luke
telephoned
the
mufti
to
come
and
calm
a
mob
that
had
gathered
under
his
window
near
the
damascus
gate
,
but
the
commissioner
'
s
impression
was
that
the
religious
leader
'
s
presence
was
having
the
opposite
effect
.
by
midday
friction
had
spread
to
the
jewish
neighborhood
of
mea
she
'
arim
where
two
or
three
arabs
were
killed
.
the
american
consulate
documented
the
event
in
detail
,
reported
that
the
killings
had
taken
place
between
12
:
00
and
12
:
30
.
the
shaw
report
described
the
excited
arab
crowds
and
that
it
was
clear
beyond
all
doubt
that
at
12
:
50
large
sections
of
these
crowds
were
bent
on
mischief
if
not
on
murder
.
at
13
:
15
,
the
arabs
began
a
massacre
of
the
jews
.
reacting
to
rumors
that
two
arabs
had
been
murdered
by
jews
,
arabs
started
an
attack
on
jews
in
jerusalem
'
s
old
city
.
the
violence
quickly
spread
to
other
parts
of
palestine
.
british
authorities
had
fewer
than
100
soldiers
,
six
armoured
cars
,
and
five
or
six
aircraft
in
country
;
palestine
police
had
1
,
500
men
,
but
the
majority
were
arab
,
with
a
small
number
of
jews
and
175
british
officers
.
while
awaiting
reinforcements
,
many
untrained
administration
officials
were
required
to
attach
themselves
to
the
police
,
though
the
jews
among
them
were
sent
back
to
their
offices
.
several
english
theology
students
visiting
from
the
university
of
oxford
were
deputized
.
while
a
number
of
jews
were
being
killed
at
the
jaffa
gate
,
british
policemen
did
not
open
fire
.
they
reasoned
that
if
they
had
shot
into
the
arab
crowd
,
the
mob
would
have
turned
their
anger
on
the
police
.
yemin
moshe
was
one
of
the
few
jewish
neighbourhoods
to
return
fire
,
but
most
of
jerusalem
'
s
jews
did
not
defend
themselves
.
at
the
outbreak
of
the
violence
and
again
in
the
following
days
,
yitzhak
ben
-
zvi
demanded
that
weapons
be
handed
to
the
jews
,
but
was
both
times
refused
.
by
august
24
,
17
jews
were
killed
in
the
jerusalem
area
.
the
worst
killings
occurred
in
hebron
and
safed
while
others
were
killed
in
motza
,
kfar
uria
,
jerusalem
and
tel
aviv
.
there
were
many
isolated
attacks
on
jewish
villages
,
and
in
six
cases
,
villages
were
entirely
destroyed
,
accompanied
by
looting
and
burning
.
in
haifa
and
jaffa
,
the
situation
deteriorated
and
a
police
officer
succeeded
in
warding
off
an
attack
on
the
quarter
between
jaffa
and
tel
aviv
by
firing
on
an
arab
crowd
.
the
administrative
director
of
haddasah
hospital
in
jerusalem
sent
a
cable
to
new
york
describing
the
casualties
and
that
arabs
were
attacking
several
jewish
hospitals
.
in
a
few
instances
,
jews
attacked
arabs
and
destroyed
arab
property
.
these
attacks
were
in
most
cases
in
retaliation
for
wrongs
already
committed
by
arabs
in
the
neighbourhood
in
which
the
jewish
attacks
occurred
.
a
police
officer
opened
fire
on
an
arab
crowd
and
succeeded
in
beating
off
an
attack
on
the
quarter
which
lies
between
jaffa
and
tel
aviv
.
the
worst
instance
of
a
jewish
attack
on
arabs
occurred
in
this
quarter
,
where
the
imam
of
a
mosque
and
six
other
persons
were
killed
.
according
to
the
shaw
report
,
the
disturbances
were
not
premeditated
and
did
not
occur
simultaneously
but
spread
from
jerusalem
through
a
period
of
days
to
most
outlying
centres
of
population
.
the
shaw
report
found
that
the
"
outbreak
in
jerusalem
on
august
23
was
from
the
beginning
an
attack
by
arabs
on
jews
for
which
no
excuse
in
the
form
of
earlier
murders
by
jews
has
been
established
.
"
later
on
23
august
,
the
british
authorities
armed
41
jewish
special
constables
,
18
jewish
ex
-
soldiers
and
a
further
60
jews
were
issued
staves
,
to
assist
in
the
defense
of
jewish
quarters
in
jerusalem
.
the
following
day
,
arab
notables
issued
a
statement
that
"
many
rumours
and
reports
of
various
kinds
have
spread
to
the
effect
that
government
had
enlisted
and
armed
certain
jews
,
that
they
had
enrolled
jewish
ex
-
soldiers
who
had
served
in
the
great
war
;
and
the
government
forces
were
firing
at
arabs
exclusively
.
"
the
mufti
of
jerusalem
stated
that
there
was
a
large
crowd
of
excited
arabs
in
the
haram
area
who
were
also
demanding
arms
,
and
that
the
excited
crowd
in
the
haram
area
took
the
view
that
the
retention
of
jews
as
special
constables
carrying
arms
was
a
breach
of
faith
by
the
government
.
the
government
initially
denied
the
rumours
,
but
by
27
august
they
were
forced
to
disband
and
disarm
the
special
constables
.
on
20
august
,
haganah
leaders
proposed
to
provide
defence
for
600
jews
of
the
old
yishuv
in
hebron
,
or
to
help
them
evacuate
.
however
,
the
leaders
of
the
hebron
community
declined
these
offers
,
insisting
that
they
trusted
the
"
a
'
yan
"
(
arab
notables
)
to
protect
them
.
on
24
august
1929
in
hebron
,
arab
mobs
attacked
the
jewish
quarter
killing
and
raping
men
,
women
and
children
and
looting
jewish
property
.
they
killed
65
68
jews
and
wounded
58
,
with
some
of
the
victims
being
tortured
,
or
mutilated
.
sir
john
chancellor
,
the
british
high
commissioner
visited
hebron
and
later
wrote
to
his
son
,
"
the
horror
of

beyond

.
in

house

less
than

that

occurred
in

desecrated
,
a
jewish
hospital
,
which
had
provided

for

personal
courage
displayed
by

cafferata
the
one
british

benevolent
arab
neighbours

offered
them
sanctuary
from

a
commission
of
enquiry
led
by
sir
walter
shaw
took
public
evidence
for
several
weeks
.
the
main
conclusions
of
the
commission
were
as
follows
.
[
material
not
in
brackets
is
verbatim
.
]
the
commission
recommended
that
the
government
reconsider
its
policies
as
to
jewish
immigration
and
land
sales
to
jews
.
this
led
directly
to
the
hope
simpson
royal
commission
in
1930
.
commission
member
henry
snell
signed
the
report
but
added
a
note
of
reservation
.
although
he
was
satisfied
that
the
mufti
was
not
directly
responsible
for
the
violence
or
had
connived
at
it
,
he
believed
the
mufti
was
aware
of
the
nature
of
the
anti
-
zionist
campaign
and
the
danger
of
disturbances
.
he
therefore
attributed
to
the
mufti
a
greater
share
of
the
blame
than
the
official
report
had
.
snell
also
disagreed
with
the
commission
on
matters
of
jewish
immigration
,
and
did
not
support
restrictions
on
jewish
land
purchases
.
regarding
the
immediate
causes
of
the
outbreak
,
snell
agreed
with
the
main
findings
of
the
commission
.
the
commission
was
headed
by
sir
john
hope
simpson
,
and
on
21
october
1930
it
produced
its
report
,
dated
1
october
1930
.
the
report
recommended
to
limit
the
jewish
immigration
due
to
the
lack
of
agricultural
land
to
support
it
.
historians
differ
in
assessing
the
role
of
the
grand
mufti
of
jerusalem
amin
al
-
husseini
in
the
riots
.
some
sources
claim
al
-
husseini
actually
incited
the
riots
,
some
claim
al
-
husseini
took
advantage
of
the
crisis
for
the
advancement
of
his
own
goals
,
and
some
claim
al
-
husseini
called
for
restraint

arata
shindo
the
character
originated
from
director
naoyoshi
shiotani
'
s
desire
to
develop
a
new
cast
for
the
sequel
to
the
previous
"
psycho
-

"
series
.
shindo
was
written
by
tow
ubukata
,
makoto
fukami
and
ryo
yoshigami
,
all
of
whom
wanted
shindo
and
ignatov
to
be
close
friends
despite
their
differences
.
shindo
'
s
characterization
caused
the
development
team
difficulties
because
he
was
intended
to
be
portrayed
as
a
likable
character
due
to
his
importance
as
a
highly
skilled
detective
.
he
was
voiced
by
yūki
kaji
,
who
enjoyed
the
work
due
to
the
character
'
s
actions
and
relationships
explored
in
the
narrative
.
critical
reception
to
shindo
has
been
positive
.
despite
him
not
being
written
by
the
series
'
first
writer
,
gen
urobuchi
,
he
fit
well
within
the
cast
thanks
to
his
mental
skills
and
further
characterization
.
his
relationship
with
ignatov
also
received
positive
responses
.
during
the
making
of
the
series
,
director
naoyoshi
shiotani
entrusted
the
writers
tow
ubukata
,
makoto
fukami
and
ryo
yoshigami
with
handling
a
new
cast
.
fukami
was
surprised
that
despite
the
new
story
and
cast
,
the
series
still
felt
like
"
psycho
-
pass
"
.
they
believed
that
the
underlying
close
relationship
between
shindo
and
ignatov
with
bifrost
would
engage
the
audience
.
shiotani
and
the
producers
also
discussed
the
idea
of
a
"
total
character
change
"
saying
,
"
think
of
them
as
two
good
buddies
"
despite
outwardly
differing
personalities
and
physical
appearance
.
ubukata
presents
shindo
shorter
than
ignatov
and
has
them
being
of
different
national
origins
.
ubukata
also
presents
the
concept
of
"
psychology
vs
.
combat
,
"
making
shindo
a
mentalist
while
ignatov
is
a
former
soldier
trained
in
martial
arts
.
and
while
shindo
'
s
cheerfulness
may
strike
one
as
naïve
compared
to
ignatov
'
s
stoic
nature
,
he
is
discovered
to
be
a
keen
sleuth
as
the
series
unfolds
.
ubukata
insisted
that
shindo
and
ignatov
be
written
by
fukami
,
who
said
early
in
the
making
of
the
series
that
ubakata
did
not
like
shindo
.
ubukata
also
said
that
shindo
appears
to
be
a
good
detective
because
he
understands
the
criminal
mind
.
fukami
also
found
shindo
a
difficult
character
to
write
because
of
his
aura
of
mystery
and
use
of
trickery
to
obtain
results
.
yoshigami
found
the
character
appealing
because
he
was
a
humanizing
factor
within
the
cast
,
comparing
him
to
"
a
con
artist
,
"
but
in
a
police
-
like
sense
.
like
all
"
psycho
-
pass
"
characters
,
shindo
was
designed
by
mangaka
akira
amano
,
who
drew
an
illustration
of
him
,
ignatov
and
fellow
character
azusawa
koichi
for
the
final
episode
of
"
psycho
-
pass
3
"
.
yūki
kaji
voiced
shindo
in
the
series
.
upon
seeing
his
character
for
the
first
time
,
kaji
found
him
stylish
.
kaji
was
overjoyed
when
he
got
the
role
of
shindo
during
the
audition
,
having
watched
the
previous
"
psycho
-
pass
"
works
and
being
a
fan
of
them
.
kaji
enjoyed
the
character
'
s
relationship
with
ignatov
due
to
their
close
relationship
and
shindo
'
s
style
of
interacting
with
the
characters
from
previous
seasons
.
kaji
laughed
when
first
reading
the
script
because
he
found
the
cast
unique
and
looked
forward
to
the
characters
'
growth
during
the
series
.
he
had
mixed
feelings
about
shindo
wielding
the
dominator
due
to
the
violence
it
can
cause
.
ignatov
'
s
voice
actor
,
yūichi
nakamura
,
also
enjoyed
the
dynamic
between
shindo
and
his
character
and
wished
the
two
were
brothers
.
the
handling
of
the
characters
'
relationships
with
their
underlings
also
appealed
to
him
.
nakamura
had
no
clear
understanding
of
shindo
and
ignatov
because
their
pasts
are
not
explored
in
the
early
episodes
and
he
looked
forward
to
the
development
of
the
series
.
shindo
is
introduced
as
one
of
two
main
protagonists
of
"
psycho
-
pass
3
"
,
which
is
set
in
a
dystopian
future
and
focuses
on
the
use
of
the
sibyl
system
,
a
hive
mind
that
uses
public
psychometric
scanners
that
calculate
the
likelihood
of
a
person
committing
a
crime
,
resulting
in
a
crime
coefficient
.
shindo
is
an
inspector
who
investigates
crime
scenes
and
pursues
individuals
with
high
crime
coefficient
readings
and
wields
a
hand
-
held
weapon
called
a
dominator
that
is
capable
of
stunning
or
destroying
a
target
depending
upon
sibyl
'
s
decision
.
shindo
is
a
mentalist
who
has
an
ability
called
a
that
allows
him
to
cross
mental
boundaries
.
he
is
also
empathic
and
skilled
in
tracking
his
targets
and
understanding
their
states
of
mind
.
his
use
of
this
skill
puts
him
at
physical
risk
and
causes
him
to
hallucinate
the
image
of
a
man
with
the
head
of
a
fox
.
it
is
later
revealed
he
is
also
"
criminally
asymptomatic
,
"
making
it
difficult
for
the
sibyl
system
to
judge
him
because
his
psycho
-
pass
is
either
low
or
non
-
existent
.
shindo
becomes
an
inspector
together
with
his
childhood
friend
and
fellow
rookie
inspector
kei
mikhail
ignatov
.
they
have
a
strong
bond
and
were
the
victims
of
a
case
that
claimed
the
lives
of
shindo
'
s
father
and
ignatov
'
s
brother
.
in
"
psycho
-
pass
3
"
,
shindo
and
ignatov
serve
under
chief
mika
shimotsuki
who
tends
to
be
irritated
by
the
duo
'
s
reckless
actions
but
allows
them
to
proceed
.
the
duo
investigates
crime
scenes
and
focus
on
a
criminal
organization
known
as
bifrost
.
critical
response
to
shindo
has
been
positive
.
ninotaku
found
him
to
be
a
well
-
developed
character
because
he
fits
with
the
other
characters
created
by
gen
urobuchi
,
especially
akane
tsunemori
.
sequential
planet
said
the
use
of
new
protagonists
was
a
risky
movement
for
the
franchise
due
to
the
popularity
of
kogami
and
tsunemori
.
nevertheless
,
the
site
further
stated
that
both
shindo
and
ignatov
are
likeable
characters
,
enjoying
the
former
more
for
his
cheerful
personality
,
which
contrasts
with
the
series
'
dark
narrative
.
due
to
the
focus
the
duo
is
given
,
the
reviewer
said
shindo
and
ignatov
are
successors
to
shinya
kogami
.
thecinemaholic
wondered
about
shindo
'
s
mentalist
skills
,
saying
although
it
might
appear
to
be
less
realistic
than
the
deductive
skills
employed
by
previous
protagonists
,
it
had
the
potential
to
be
executed
in
a
positive
fashion
in
later
episodes
.
due
to
his
portrayal
,
shindo
was
compared
to
steven
moffat
'
s
and
mark
gatiss
'
s
portrayals
of
sherlock
holmes
in
the
2010
'
s
television
series
.
thecinemaholic
praised
shindo
'
s
and
igantov
'
s
roles
in
later
episodes
for

shindo
was
also
praised
by
anime
news
network
for
the
way
his
mentalist
skills
added
a
new
element
to
investigations
and
the
air
of
mystery
it
gave
to

the

noted
that

lead
characters

the
more
their

became
chaotic
,
citing
shindo
'

hallucinations

the
hidden
aspects
of
his
father
'
s
death
.
the
focus
given
to
shindo
and
ignatov
in

finale
also
earned
positive
responses
for
the
uncertainty
created
regarding
whether
or
not
they
would
betray

stated
that
shindo
'
s
mental
trace
added
depth
to
his
character
though
he
might
come
across
as
ambiguous
when
analyzed
and
that
he
,
too
,
underwent
a
notable
character
arc
,
becoming
more
mature
with
potential
for
further
development
.
in
a
further
analysis
of
the
finale
'
s
narrative
,
the
site
agreed
with
anime
news
network
regarding
the
handling
of
the
duo
in
saying
ignatov
was
the
more
explored
character
of
the
pair
because
of
the
likely
outcome
of
his
final
decision
and
its
effect
on

1946
soviet

state
elections
state
elections
were
held
in
the
soviet
occupation
zone
of
germany
on
20
october
1946
to
elect
the
state
legislatures
of
mecklenburg
-
vorpommern
,
brandenburg
,
saxony
,
saxony
-
anhalt
and
thuringia
.
they
were
the
only
elections
held
in
the
future
territory
of
east
germany
before
the
establishment
of
the
german
democratic
republic
in
1949
.
the
socialist
unity
party
of
germany
(
sed
)
,
which
was
formed
by
the
forced
merger
of
the
communist
party
and
the
social
democratic
party
in
the
soviet
occupation
zone
,
became
the
strongest
party
,
but
only
achieved
an
absolute
majority
in
one
state
.
the
sed
was
created
in
view
of
the
holding
of
elections
in
the
soviet
zone
,
as
a
first
step
for
future
political
reforms
.
in
addition
to
the
sed
,
three
other
parties
participated
;
the
christian
democratic
union
(
cdu
)
,
the
liberal
democratic
party
(
ldp
)
and
the
peasants
mutual
aid
association
(
vdgb
)
.
two
other
organizations
participated
but
only
in
saxony
.
the
sed
results
were
disappointing
for
the
soviet
authorities
and
contributed
decisively
to
the
modification
of
the
right
to
vote
in
the
soviet
occupation
zone
in
the
following
years
.
from
then
on
,
voters
could
only
vote
for
a
sed
controlled
unity
list
or
reject
it
.
the
next
state
elections
were
held
in
1950

after
the
establishment

chalais

meudon
chalais
-
meudon
is
an
aeronautical
research
and
development
centre
in
meudon
,
to
the
south
-
west
of
paris
.
it
was
originally
founded
in
1793
in
the
nearby
château
de
meudon
and
has
played
an
important
role
in
the
development
of
french
aviation
.
the
story
of
aviation
at
chalais
-
meudon
starts
in
october
1793
when
the
french
public
safety
committee
ordered
the
construction
of
an
observation
balloon
capable
of
carrying
two
observers
.
the
old
royal
grounds
at
meudon
were
allocated
for
this
work
,
with
the
château
de
meudon
chosen
as
the
centre
,
with
nicolas
-
jacques
conté
as
director
.
two
french
balloon
corps
balloon
companies
had
already
been
created
,
and
the
new
organisation
'
s
role
was
to
build
balloons
and
train
their
pilots
and
operators
.
the
first
balloon
,
the
"
entreprenant
"
,
was
built
within
four
months
,
and
on
31
october
1794
,
the
national
school
of
ballooning
was
created
,
with
conté
as
its
director
.
many
other
balloons
were
then
built
in
a
short
period
,
including
,
in
1795
,
"
l
intrépide
"
which
,
with
the
first
balloon
company
,
was
captured
by
austrian
troops
in
1796
,
and
is
now
on
display
at
the
austrian
military
museum
in
vienna
-
the
oldest
aircraft
in
europe
.
they
were
all
spherical
hydrogen
balloons
with
a
diameter
of
at
least
.
conté
himself
had
improved
production
methods
for
hydrogen
and
the
treatment
of
the
gas
bags
.
in
1798
napoleon
sent
one
of
the
balloon
companies
in
one
ship
to
egypt
.
it
was
sunk
by
the
british
at
aboukir
and
all
the
equipment
was
lost
.
the
two
balloon
companies
were
disbanded
soon
afterwards
,
and
work
on
balloons
at
meudon
ceased
.
in
1877
,
balloons
had
regained
their
importance
after
their
successful
use
in
the
siege
of
paris
(
1870
71
)
.
léon
gambetta
,
the
minister
for
war
,
who
had
himself
escaped
from
paris
by
balloon
,
created
a
commission
of
air
communications
,
and
colonel
charles
renard
was
put
in
charge
of
military
ballooning
.
in
1877
,
he
became
director
of
the
"
l
'
etablissement
central
de
l
'
aérostation
militaire
"
(
central
establishment
of
military
ballooning
)
,
and
he
created
corps
of
balloonists
,
with
a
research
centre
at
meudon
.
this
was
a
new
development
in
the
grounds
of
the
château
and
on
the
edge
of
the
forest
of
meudon
.
it
included
a
hexagonal
lake
,
the
étang
de
chalais
,
hence
the
location
was
named
chalais
-
meudon
.
a
large
series
of
buildings
was
planned
.
it
included
the
research
laboratory
for
military
ballooning
which
became
the
military
aeronautical
laboratory
.
the
universal
exhibition
in
paris
in
1878
had
a
huge
great
gallery
of
machines
,
designed
by
henri
de
dion
.
renard
brought
the
structure
to
chalais
-
meudon
for
use
as
a
balloon
store
and
workshop
.
it
was
named
hangar
y
(
all
buildings
at
the
site
were
allocated
a
letter
)
and
the
building
nearest
to
it
,
which
was
used
for
the
production
of
hydrogen
,
was
named
building
z
.
hangar
y
has
dimensions
of
:
length
,
width
,
height
.
balloons
continued
to
be
developed
and
built
here
,
with
great
expansion
of
balloon
manufacturing
during
world
war
i
.
balloon
parks
were
created
,
with
steam
winches
used
to
move
the
balloons
,
and
most
of
the
components
were
built
on
site
,
including
wicker
baskets
and
hydrogen
generators
.
especially
important
at
that
time
were
the
caquot
balloons
,
produced
for
all
the
allied
countries
.
the
designer
,
albert
caquot
went
on
to
plan
the
chalais
-
meudon
wind
tunnel
and
to
propose
the
aviation
museum
(
see
below
)
.
balloon
production
ended
in
1918
.
hangar
y
was
at
first
used
for
balloons
,
but
renard
soon
started
work
on
airships
,
which
the
building
could
also
accommodate
.
this
was
therefore
the
world
'
s
first
airship
hangar
,
and
one
of
very
few
that
remain
in
europe
.
the
first
airship
to
be
built
was
"
la
france
"
.
in
building
it
,
renard
collaborated
with
arthur
constantin
krebs
,
one
of
france
'
s
most
notable
inventors
.
its
first
flight
was
on
9
august
1884
.
taking
off
from
outside
hangar
y
,
it
flew
over
villacoublay
before
returning
and
landing
safely
at
its
takeoff
point
,
a
flight
of
about
taking
23
minutes
.
this
was
the
first
ever
fully
controlled
closed
-
circuit
flight
by
a
flying
machine
.
it
was
propelled
by
an
electric
motor
,
but
the
batteries
were
so
heavy
that
even
the
designers
recognised
that
it
was
,
at
the
time
,
a
dead
end
,
and
after
a
further
six
successful
flights
,
its
development
was
abandoned
.
another
airship
was
built
here
in
1895
,
named
the
"
général
meusnier
"
after
jean
baptiste
meusnier
who
had
a
concept
for
a
dirigible
balloon
in
1784
.
neither
project
flew
.
there
was
a
lot
of
airship
activity
in
the
early
20th
century
.
in
1901
alberto
santos
-
dumont
based
his
number
6
airship
here
.
many
airships
visited
for
demonstrations
or
testing
,
including
those
from
the
lebaudy
brothers
.
their
"
patrie
"
was
here
in
1906
-
7
,
followed
by
"
la
république
"
in
1908
-
9
.
data
from
the
army
found
that
airships
were
becoming
decreasingly
useful
during
wwi
,
and
on
1
january
1918
all
airships
were
transferred
to
the
navy
.
construction
and
delivery
of
the
cm
series
for
the
navy
was
completed
,
but
cm
.
6
to
cm
.
8
had
also
been
ordered
,
but
were
not
built
.
the
last
airship
to
use
hangar
y
was
the
voliris
900
.
this
modern
commercial
airship
,
long
,
was
assembled
,
inflated
and
given
a
public
presentation
here
in
2002
.
it
was
then
dismantled
and
moved
to
clermont
-
ferrand
for
flight
testing
the
following
year
.
émile
dorand
was
a
balloonist
and
engineer
,
who
had
been
at
chalais
-
meudon
since
1907
and
was
appointed
head
of
the
military
aeronautical
laboratory
.
after
that
closed
,
he
was
appointed
as
the
first
director
of
the
service
technique
de
l
'
aéronautique
(
staé
)
on
28
february
1916
.
this
was
still
based
at
chalais
-
meudon
,
and
he
continued
with
one
of
his
interests
kites
.
he
had
developed
ever
-
larger
kites
,
capable
of
supporting
a
man
,
and
some
were
powered
,
with
a
"
nacelle
"
(
fuselage
structure
)
which
was
suspended
underneath
large
wings
,
and
which
had
a
steerable
engine
and
propeller
at
the
front
.
while
these
showed
some
promise
,
and
kites
were
being
used
by
the
army
,
the
concepts
were
being
overtaken
by
other
ideas
,
so
the
interest
in
kites
only
lasted
from
around
1908
to
1916
,
by
when
all
kite
equipment
had
been
returned
to
chalais
-
meudon
,
never
to
be
used
again
.
one
of
the
earliest
experiments
with
aeroplanes
at
chalais
-
meudon
was
conducted
by
victor
tatin
who
in
1879
developed
a
model
monoplane
,
with
a
wing
span
of
,
powered
by
a
compressed
air
engine
.
tied
to
a
central
pole
in
a
circular
track
it
took
off
and
flew
for
about
entirely
under
its
own
power
-
the
first
model
aeroplane
ever
to
do
so
.
from
1902
to
1905
renard
invited
several
aviation
experimenters
to
have
devices
built
or
tested
at
chalais
-
meudon
.
they
included
léon
levavasseur
,
ernest
archdeacon
and
ferdinand
ferber
.
in
1910
the
laboratory
acquired
around
20
aircraft
and
started
training
military
pilots
.
more
facilities
for
research
and
testing
were
installed
,
including
test
benches
and
wind
tunnels
.
marcel
bloch
worked
at
the
laboratory
during
world
war
i
,
developing
a
propeller
named
the
"
éclair
"
and
,
with
henry
potez
who
was
the
dorand
'
s
assistant
at
the
staé
,
and
louis
coroller
,
formed
a
company
,
the
"
société
d
'
études
aéronautiques
"
to
produce
the
sea
series
of
fighters
.
on
12
january
1918
commander
caquot
replaced
colonel
durand
as
director
of
the
staé
.
at
the
end
of
wwi
the
staé
itself
moved
to
the
issy
-
les
-
moulineaux
,
about
to
the
north
-
east
of
chalais
-
meudon
,
taking
some
of
the
research
activities
with
it
,
but
retaining
some
activities
at
chalais
-
meudon
.
its
activities
continued
between
the
wars
,
but
with
only
a
small
flying
field
available
much
of
the
aircraft
testing
was
moved
to
the
nearby
villacoublay
airfield
about
to
the
south
-
west
,
and
the
rest
of
the
aircraft
testing
,
and
some
other
research
activities
went
to
issy
.
during
the
occupation
of
world
war
ii
,
german
researchers
used
the
facilities
,
including
the
great
wind
tunnel
,
for
testing
their
own
aircraft
and
interesting
captured
french
designs
such
as
the
payen
pa
-
22
.
in
1946
,
the
engine
testing
service
moved
back
to
chalais
-
meudon
and
became
the
"
centre
d
'
essai
des
moteurs
et
hélices
"
(
cemh
)
.
in
1929
albert
caquot
began
planning
for
what
was
then
the
largest
wind
tunnel
in
the
world
.
it
was
designed
by
antonin
lapresle
,
who
was
a
colleague
of
gustave
eiffel
who
had
built
two
wind
tunnels
with
great
success
in
paris
in
1909
and
1912
.
building
started
in
1932
and
it
was
completed
in
1934
.
it
was
capable
of
testing
complete
aircraft
up
to
span
.
built
of
reinforced
concrete
,
it
was
powered
by
six
fans
of
each
,
and
airspeeds
could
reach
.
named
the
s1ch
wind
tunnel
,
and
also
called
"
la
grande
soufflerie
"
(
the
great
wind
tunnel
)
,
it
has
been
used
for
testing
cars
and
buildings
,
as
well
as
aircraft
including
the
dassault
mirage
iii
,
the
caravelle
and
concorde
.
it
closed
in
1977
and
is
preserved
as
a
historic
monument
.
in
1919
,
albert
caquot
proposed
the
setting
up
of
an
aeronautical
museum
,
and
items
were
collected
at
issy
-
les
-
moulineaux
and
at
chalais
-
meudon
,
with
many
items
preserved
from
the
balloon
,
engine
and
aviation
activities
that
had
taken
place
at
those
locations
.
the
items
were
soon
gathered
into
the
balloon
basket
hangar
at
chalais
-
meudon
,

schoenus
ligulatus
schoenus
ligulatus
is
a
species
of
sedge
endemic
to
the
western
regions
of
the
western
cape
province
of
south
africa
.
the
key
diagnostic
character
of
"
s
.
ligulatus
"
are
its
linear
-
lanceolate
spikelets
and
narrow
elliptic
nutlets
.
"
schoenus
exilis
"
resembles
"
s
.
ligulatus
"
,
but
the
former
is
a
shorter
species
(
<
350
mm
)
compared
to
the
taller
"
s
.
ligulatus
"
(
>
350
mm
)
.
in
addition
,
the
spikelets
of
"
s
.
exilis
"
are
shorter
(
mostly
<
4
.
5
mm
)
compared
to
those
of
"
s
.
ligulatus
"
.
another
key
difference
between
the
two
species
is
that
"
s
.
exilis
"
often
has
membranaceous
ligules
,
whereas
the
ligules
of
"
s
.
ligulatus
"
tend
to
be
firmer
.
"
schoenus
quartziticus
"
is
also
a
similar
species
;
however
,
it
has
broad
elliptic
nutlets
and
shorter
spikelets
(
<
4
.
0
mm
)
compared
to
those
of
"
s
.
ligulatus
"
.
similar
to
other
sedges
,
plants
in
this
group
are
very
difficult
to
identify
.
it
appears
that
part
of
this
problem
is
caused
by
the
tendency
of
the
southern
african
"
schoenus
"
to
form
hybrids
with
each
other
.
it
appears
that
"
schoenus
ligulatus
"
forms
hybrids
with
other
southern
african
"
schoenus
"
species
,
specifically
"
schoenus
cuspidatus
